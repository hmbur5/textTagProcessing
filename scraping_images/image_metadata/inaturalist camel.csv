Its native range is unclear, but it was probably the Arabian Peninsula. The domesticated form occurs widely in North Africa and the Middle East. The world's only population of dromedaries exhibiting wild behaviour is an introduced feral population in Australia.
The dromedary camel is the largest member of the camel family. Other living members of the camel family include the Bactrian camel, as well as the South American species llama, alpaca, vicuña and guanaco. The dromedary has one hump on its back, in contrast to the two humps on the Bactrian camel.

The 14 million dromedaries alive today are domesticated animals (mostly living in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Maghreb, Middle East and the Indian subcontinent). The Horn region alone has the largest concentration of camels in the world, where the dromedaries constitute an important part of local nomadic life. They provide peripatetic Somali and Ethiopian people with milk, food and transportation.",2021-04-05 16:31:17

I know this isn't a wild species, but it is pretty unique to see a camel in the PNW! She has one hump, shaggy fur, and if you get to close she will mistake your hair for food and try to eat it.

None of the camels in the herd have the ring in the nose, which is only done in western countries.  Instead, the Bedouin, whose very lives depend on the camels, train them from birth for at least three years, allowing the babies to come on walks with their mum who are the ones who carry people and equipment.  

The herd just walks and it can be quite scary to have the camel you are riding shoot off and be in the lead when you do not have a clue where you are going and you do not have reins to pull them back!  The Bedouin control the herd by voice commands, not raised or shouting, but just a gentle ""turn right"" in their language and the whole herd turns.  Not every adult camel is riden, but the herd as a whole (minus the males) always travel together.  Witnessing the rapour that the Bedouin and camels have was truely astounding and being able to be a part of this unique way of life very humbling.",2021-04-05 16:31:17

Habitat/ Geographic Range: The dromedary camel can be found in arid desert environments with long dry seasons and short rainy seasons which serves them well as they are very sensitive to cold weather (Nelson,  Bwala, & Nuhu, 2015). They inhabit many regions throughout the Middle East, the arid deserts of Northern Africa, Northern India, the Sahara Desert and have a modest population in Australia (Nelson et al., 2015).

Size, Weight & Lifespan: Dromedary camels are large animals reaching up to 10ft in length, with males weighing between 400-600kg with heights typically between 5.9- 6.6 ft as adults, and females weighing between 300-540kg with average heights ranging between 5.6-6.2 ft as adults (Nelson et al., 2015). The average lifespan for both male and female dromedary camels is 40 years (Nelson et al., 2015).

Diet: Dromedary camels are browsers, meaning they are herbivores who forage at great lengths (up to 6 hours a day) for food (Nelson et al., 2015). In a preference study conducted by Field (1979), whereby dromedary camels were given the option between two food choices and had to choose the preferred option, it was found that the average preferred diet of the dromedary camel consisted of dwarf shrubs, trees, grasses, herbs, and vines. This makes sense as their long necks and long legs enable them to obtain leaves and herbs from tall tree’s out of reach from other animals, and the thick skin that lines the inside of their mouths allows them to chew prickly plants such as vines that other animals cannot eat (Nelson et al., 2015).	

Reproduction: Dromedary Camels are seasonal breeders and copulation tends to occur once a year within the winter months and peak during the rainy season (Bahrawy, Khalifa, & Rateb, 2015). Female dromedary camels reach sexual maturity at the average age of 3 but will usually not begin to mate until the age of 4 and males around the age of 6 (Nelson et al., 2015). During mating season male camels will attempt to attract a receptive female by exhibiting rutting behaviors (Padalino, Monaco, Lacalandra, 2015). These behaviors typically consist of extrusion of the soft palate and splashing of their urine onto their hump and legs (Padalino et al., 2015). Copulation begins by the male smelling the genitalia of the female and biting around her hump, followed by him grasping the females forelegs with his own legs to force her into a seated position and allow for intromission (Padalino et al., 2015). On average, copulation lasts for about 10-20 minutes with an average of 3 to 4 ejaculations occurring (Padalino et al., 2015). Once impregnated, the length of gestation is about 12-13 months (Nelson et al., 2015). Dromedary female camels are induced ovulators whereby coitus triggers ovulation (Bahrawy, 2015). Hassanein et al., (2010), found that placement of seminal fluid in the vagina triggered luteinizing hormone (LH) release, a hormone required to induce ovulation, whereas mechanical stimulation of the cervix did not (Hassanein et al., 2010).This is due to the fact that dromedary semen has an ovulation-inducing factor which stimulates the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, a hormone that stimulates LH release from the pituitary (Adams & Ratto, 2012). Despite these studies being conducted in 2010 and 2012, I believe they best illustrate the physiological mechanisms behind induced ovulation in the female dromedary compared to any other literature. 

Communication: A focal animal sampling ethogram whereby multiple dromedary camels were observed in restricted enclosures for a fixed amount of time found that communication consists primarily of vocalizations and scent marking (Padalino et al., 2015) . Dromedary camels are very vocal animals and can make a number of sounds ranging from groans, roars, and moans to communicate specific feelings (Padalino et al., 2015) For example, a rutting male will emit a “blo-blo” type sound to communicate that he is looking for a receptive female (Padalino et al., 2015). Scent marking refers to male camels spreading their back legs and spraying their urine onto themselves which communicates to females that a male wants to mate (Padalino et al., 2015).  Nelson et al., (2015) also observed that stamping feet and vomiting cud at other camels communicates displeasure and aggression.

Predators: Due to the domestication of dromedary camels about 5,000 years ago, predation of these large animals is very limited (Nelson et al., 2015). Dromedary camels also inhabit very dry, arid regions, where very few carnivorous animals are found. However, before the domestication of these animals, their main predators were lions and leopards (Nelson et al., 2015). 

Conservation Status: As of today, the wild dromedary camel population is extinct due to semi-domestication, meaning they are free ranging in their natural habitat but under the control of humans (Nelson et al., 2015). Therefore, their conservation status is domesticated. 

Did You Know: Contrary to popular belief, the dromedary camel’s hump is not filled with water, but is instead a site for fat storage. To survive in arid-desert environments, where water and food are often scarce, dromedary camels have adopted a remarkable adaptive mechanism whereby they are able to store fat reserves in their hump which are broken down into carbohydrates and therefore provide the animal with abundant amounts of ATP energy(Adams & Ratto, 2013). This allows them to go weeks at a time without food (Adams & Ratto, 2013). When this fat is metabolized, water is produced as a byproduct which allows for camels to survive upwards of two weeks without drinking water (Adams & Ratto, 2013).
