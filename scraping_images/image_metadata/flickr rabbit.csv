You're causing permanent damage to your metabolism, your immune system...

Trying to lose weight this way is the same as using sand-paper to take off your makeup each night....

....it’s overkill, it doesn’t make sense and more importantly – IT’S DANGEROUS!

And trust me I know,

Giving in is easy because each one of their million-dollar marketing tactics preys on women like you and I by seducing you with exactly what you want to hear in your most vulnerable moments...

Description: After the lighthouse, we decided to skip Pinware River Provincial Park so we could get some food at a store in Forteau and come back to the hotel to eat it.  This was the first day of the trip where we didn't eat in a restaurant.  Before supper, we took a stroll down the hill, where we saw the floor of a building that had been torn down, and saw a rabbit beside a stream.

I went out to the backyard to get something from the shed and couldn't believe there was a wild rabbit. I have never seen one around here before. I ran bank in the house quick to get my camera hoping he would still be there. He hung around for a few minutes allowing me to get some sots of him. Looks to be in the middle of color change.

Have a great week friends

Description: Cavendish Mews is a smart set of flats in Mayfair where flapper and modern woman, the Honourable Lettice Chetwynd has set up home after coming of age and gaining her allowance.  To supplement her already generous allowance, and to break away from dependence upon her family, Lettice has established herself as a society interior designer, so her flat is decorated with a mixture of elegant antique Georgian pieces and modern Art Deco furnishings, using it as a showroom for what she can offer to her well heeled clients.

Today however, we have followed Lettice from her home to just a short distance away.  Still in Mayfair, she is visiting Asprey* in Bond Street: jewellers to the royal family, silversmiths and goldsmiths and suppliers of luxury goods.  With Dickie Channon and Margot de Virre’s engagement announced, Lettice is charged with finding a wedding gift not only of her own, but for her parents to send to the home of Margot’s parents.  Leaving the busy shopping strip populated by suited men on their way to their offices and clubs and smartly dressed ladies enjoying a day of shopping, Lettice slips in through the beautiful full length glass doors of Asprey’s into the cossetted comfort of the light filled luxury shop.  Leaving the bustle of London behind her with the quiet click of the doors closing, she breathes in the gentle waft of expensive perfume and leather.  

“Ah!  Miss Chetwynd!”  a mature frock coated shop walker greets Lettice with a broad smile.  “How do you do.”

Lettice greets the stout, smartly dressed man with the familiarity of the regular client that she is.  “How do you do, Crosbie,”  she addresses him as she does her family butler.

“And to what do we owe this great pleasure of your visit, Miss Chetwynd?”  Mr. Crosbie asks obsequiously, clasping his glove clad hands together behind his back.  “A finishing touch for one of your latest interiors, perhaps?  I have some lovely silver tea services just in from our silversmiths.”

Lettice looks distractedly around the beautiful mahogany display cabinets filled with leather dressing cases and travel de necessaires, candelabras, coffee and tea services.

“Not today, Crosbie,”  she flashes him one of her winning smiles, not fooled for a moment by the portly floor walker’s flattery and toady behaviour.  

Lettice knows that when she walks into Asprey’s that she is a valued customer because of how much money she spends there and how much influence she has on others who also patronise the shop.  Her mind slips back to her first visit to Asprey as a teenager before the war, when she accompanied her mother who was looking to buy some new jewellery for a court levee.  The frock coated staff fawned over Viscountess Wrexham and her daughter noticed for the first time the deference paid not only to her mother, but to her as well as a member of a family held in such high esteem and a future patron of the shop.  

“A new travel de necessaire for your next country house soirée, perhaps?”  Mr. Crosbie asks attentively.  “Or maybe some new pearls for the Season?”

“No, nothing like that today, Crosbie,”  Lettice replies.

“Please,”  Mr. Crosbie indicates with a sweeping gesture to a small mahogany Queen Anne style table decorated with a white vase filled with fragrant rose blooms, flanked by two dainty velvet seated salon chairs.  “Some tea perhaps, Miss Chetwynd?”

“Oh Crosbie,”  she sighs, sinking into one of the chairs, crossing her legs elegantly and propping her black handled green parasol against her thigh.  “You are a brick!”

The older manager looks over and catches the eye of a junior member of staff to whom he nods almost imperceptibly.  The younger man quietly slips away from behind a counter of silver salvers and trays and disappears into the back of the showroom.

“Then,”  Mr. Crosbie asks, taking his place adjunct to Lettice.  “What is your pleasure today, Miss Chetwynd?”

Lettice’s eyes the glittering shelves again.  Champagne buckets, strawberry dishes, biscuit barrels, lidded chafing dishes, trophies and meat covers all polished to a gleaming sheen wink and glow against their mahogany housings or in glass display cases, under the morning light from the street outside and diffused light from crystal chandeliers overhead.

“Well, you would no doubt have read in The Times that my friends Margot de Virre and Richard Channon have recently become engaged.”

Crosbie’s gleaming brown eyes lift towards the ceiling and his mouth falls open ever so slightly as he considers the names of all the newly engaged couples of note announced in the London newspapers.  “The Marquess of Taunton’s son and Lord de Virre’s daughter,”  he remarks thoughtfully.  “Yes, I did see that.  Ah!”  

The younger shop walker arrives with a silver tray laden with a sleek teapot, sugar bowl, milk jug, a cup and saucer and a selection of biscuits on a plate.  He carefully places the tray on the table, next to Lettice’s crocodile skin handbag.  Mr. Crosbie nods ever so slightly at the younger man and he retreats, walking quietly back across the carpeted floor.

“So, you see my dilemma Crosbie,”  Lettice says.  “I need a wedding gift.”

“Well, Miss Chetwynd,”  the older man says in an assuring tone.  “You aren’t the first person to visit Asprey to purchase a wedding gift for them.”  He pauses.  “However we have so many lovely things to choose from, that I feel sure we shall find the perfect gift from you.”

“Oh it isn’t just for me, Crosbie,”  Lettice replies apologetically.  “I also need a wedding gift for my parents.”

“Ah!  How is his Lordship?”  Mr. Crosbie asks.  “And her Ladyship?”

“Quite well thank you, Crosbie,”  Lettice states.  “However, they are too ensconced in Wiltshire to come to London to select their own gift.”

“Well, I’m sure we can find a suitable gift for them too, Miss Chetwynd.”  He smiles politely.  “Shall I pour?”

“Oh, you are a brick, Crosbie!”  Lettice says.  “Yes please.”

As he pours, Mr. Crosbie artfully makes sure that the sleek body of the teapot and its elegant spout catches the light and the attention of his customer.

“That’s a lovely teapot, Crosbie,”  Lettice remarks thoughtfully.  

“It’s one of the new tea services we have just received from our silversmiths.”  He adds hopefully,  “It is Georgian Revival Moderne: very fashionable Miss Chetwynd.  Will you take milk and sugar?”

“Yes, thank you, Crosbie.  Oh, and the crockery?”

“Also in a new and very fashionable line, Miss Chetwynd.”  Mr. Crosbie adds with delight that Lettice has noticed it.  “Do have a chocolate or a vanilla Bourbon biscuit.”

“Thank you, Crosbie.”  She picks up a chocolate cream Huntley and Palmer’s biscuit and munches daintily on it.  After finishing her mouthful and taking a sip of tea she continues, “Now.  I want something different.  Something special for two of my closest friends: not just a tea set.”  Crosbie’s face falls slightly at her words.  “Anyone can give a tea set.”

“Indeed, Miss Chetwynd.”  Mr. Crosbie acquiesces with a slight lilt of disappointment.  

“No!”  Lettice continues.  “I want something, different.  The Marquess is giving the newlyweds a house near Penzance as a country retreat.  I am told it is a Regency house.  I’d like to give them something suitable for there.  What can you show me, Crosbie?”

The older man’s eyes light up again.  “Ah!  Well, Asprey’s do have a few rather lovely pieces that might suit.  If I could beg your indulgence, Miss Chetwynd.”

Lettice nods in agreement as the man moves purposefully across the red carpeted floor to the mahogany display shelves where he fetches several pieces.  She continues to enjoy the Bourbon biscuits and her tea whilst he searches for potential presents.  Returning, he places two lidded boxes and a tray on the table before her.

“A Regency Revival letter tray, and two Georgian Revival tea caddies, Miss Chetwynd.”  Mr. Crosbie says soothingly with a flourish of his hands worthy of a magician having produced a rabbit from a hat.

Lettice scrutinises each, carefully picking them up and considering them as gifts.  Across the table from her, Mr. Crosbie quietly holds his breath as he watches, clutching his glove glad hands together beneath the table’s surface.  

“Yes,”  Lettice says at length.  “Yes, I think the larger of the tea caddies, Crosbie.”

“Very good, Miss Chetwynd.”  Mr. Crosbie enthuses.  “And for your parents?”

“Oh, the tea service, definitely.”  she replies with a wry smile.  “They are very good at giving tea sets.”

“Very good, Miss Chetwynd.  I’ll have the accounts drawn out.  Shall I have the tea service and the tea caddy sent directly to Lord and Lady de Virre with a small note of compliments from you and the Viscount?&quot;

“The tea set, yes,”  Lettice says.  “But the tea caddy, no.  Please have that sent to me.”

“Certainly Miss Chetwynd.  I can have it delivered to you this afternoon, if that suits.”

“Splendid Crosbie,”  Lettice smiles and sighs, relieved that she has the perfect wedding gift for her friends.  Finishing her tea, she grasps her parasol and handbag and prepares to leave.  Then, as an after thought she adds, “Oh, and have another of those tea services sent to me as well.”  She looks again at the sleek teapot glinting on the tray.  “I quite like the way the pot pours.”

“Yes, Miss Chetwynd!”  Mr. Crosbie says with undisguised pleasure.

*Founded in 1781 as a silk printing business by William Asprey, Asprey soon became a luxury emporium.  In 1847 the business moved to their present premises at 167 Bond Street, where they advertised 'articles of exclusive design and high quality, whether for personal adornment or personal accompaniment and to endow with richness and beauty the table and homes of people of refinement and discernment’.  In 1862 Asprey received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria.  They received a second Royal Warrant from the Future Edward VII in 1889.  Asprey has a tradition of producing jewellery inspired by the blooms found in English gardens and Woodland Flora. Over the decades jewelled interpretations of flowers have evolved to include Daisy, Woodland and sunflower collections.  They have their own special cut of diamond and produce leather goods, silver and gold pieces, trophies and leatherbound books, both old and new.  They also produce accessories for playing polo.  In 1997, Asprey produced the Heart of the Ocean necklace worn in the motion picture blockbuster, ‘Titanic’.   

This luxury goods shop floor with all its silver may appear real to you, however it is fashioned entirely of 1:12 miniatures from my collection.  Some of the items in this tableaux are amongst the very first pieces I ever received as a young child.

Fun things to look for in this tableaux include:

The panoply of silver items that full the shelves and cabinets were once commonplace items in both upper and middle-class households.  These items include candelabras, candlesticks, a biscuit barrel, an egg cruet set, a lidded muffin dish, a punch bowl, a toast rack, vases, trophies, coffee sets, tea sets, a strawberry dish, lidded chafing and serving dishes, meat covers, gravy boats, a water jug, an ice bucket, a sweetmeat dish, silver trays and salvers, and tea caddies.  Almost all of the silver pieces in this scene are exclusively made by Warwick Miniatures in Ireland, who are well known for the quality and detail applied to their pieces.  The only pieces not made by them are the square tray and tea service in the foreground, and the three prong Arts and Crafts style candelabra which sits atop a stand in front of the mahogany cases.  The square tray and tea service in the foreground, which come from Smallskale Miniatures in the United Kingdom.  The three prong candelabra is an artisan piece of sterling silver made in Berlin and is actually only 3 centimetres in height and 3 centimetres in width. 

The Queen Anne table and two chairs in the foreground were amongst the first miniatures I was ever given as a child.  They were birthday presents given to me when I was seven years old.

Lettice’s snakeskin handbag with its gold clasp and chain comes from Doreen Jeffries’ Small Wonders Miniature Shop in the United Kingdom.  Lettice’s umbrella also comes from Smallskale Miniatures in the United Kingdom.

The Art Deco style teacup, saucer and plate come from an EBay stockist of miniatures, whilst the tiny chocolate and vanilla Bourbon biscuits from Beautifully Handmade Miniatures in Kettering in the United Kingdom.  They specialise in miniature foods, and the array of items they have along with the fine and realistic detail of their hand made pieces is quite amazing!

The vase of roses on the Queen Anne table is beautifully made by hand by the Doll House Emporium.",2021-04-14 10:00:37

Description: ...redux. Enough of horrible slies. I snagged more of the unseen twilight work of Igor at the edge of Golden Ponds on unprotected trees while  sidelined before my move back to the Thistle apartment and their ongoing punishment of unfinished construction. Well, anyway, I started a spread sheet to date stamp and log their current lies and continue to make entries! Really? What were my expectations for this crowd? The re-move labor was shifted to renters and I am currently through some of my massive second multiple moving box cleanup. Now where is my laptop with Vista that works better than Win-10? Even Windows-10 shut off my card reader slots so I am currently stuck again without investing extensive time, fencing, Gates and excess labor. MicroSloth 10 has been closing in on me from every angle. Ahh, if MicroSloth ever finished one single operating system like Windows CE, ME or NT. What does it spell, kiddies?

The staff tries to keep the wildlife under control and are looping rabbit wire around the trunks of some trees. The beaver finds the others.

I am praying the ponds rebound soon this spring, these won't, after both jabs and if I manage to avoid herd immunity (today is over two weeks after my second and last jab) when they really mean herd stupidity. CU Boulder students erupted again - I thought they checked for IQ before college and presidential acceptance. We are currently about 10-15 degrees over normal in the valley. We could use a lot more masks worn at Logmont parks, especially for the covidiots. Why take advice from scientist or doctors warning of consequences?

Introduced in 1951 the A30 Van was replaced by the almost identical A35 (1956-68) differances include the painted front grille with chrome horse shoe surround replaced the all chrome grille of the A30. (The saloons have a larger rear window).  Front and rear flashers replaced the A30 semaphore signals, and a the A30 had a four speed box with the first three ratios close together the A35 had a more evenly spaced ratios. The later A35 engine from 1962  increased from 1962 to 1098cc. This is one of the early A35 vans, later vans have the semaphore signal area covered

The wet bare tree branches and the fog make for a nice background and contrast with the dry porch interior.

Description: A  red-shouldered hawk is perched  in a backyard tree, checking the land for prey. The red-shouldered hawk’s breeding range spans eastern North America and along the coast of California and northern to northeastern-central Mexico. It is a permanent resident throughout most of its range, though northern birds do migrate, mostly to central Mexico. As in many birds of prey, the male is smaller than the female.  Juvenile red-shouldered hawks are most likely to be confused with juvenile broad-winged hawks, but can be distinguished by their long tails and  crescent-like wing markings. Red-shouldered hawks are forest raptors. In the east, they live in bottomland hardwood stands, flooded deciduous swamps, and upland mixed deciduous–conifer forests. They tend to live in stands with an open subcanopy, which makes hunting easier. They are not exclusively birds of deep forest, though; one can find red-shouldered hawks in some suburban areas where houses or other buildings are mixed into woodlands. Red-shouldered hawks search for prey while perched on a treetop or soaring over woodlands. When they sight prey, they kill it by dropping directly onto it from the air. They may cache food near their nest for later consumption. When in clearings, they sometimes fly low to surprise prey. Red-shouldered hawks, like most raptors, have very sharp vision and reasonably good hearing, with talons capable of killing animals at least equal to their own size. Small mammals are typically the most important prey,  especially rodents. Voles, gophers, mice, moles and chipmunks may locally be favored based on abundance. Slightly larger mammals, such as rabbits and tree squirrels, are also occasionally preyed on. They will attack birds up to a fair size.  During winters, red-shouldered hawks sometimes habituate to preying on birds commonly found at bird feeders.  Springfield, Va.  4 April 2021",2021-04-14 10:00:52

Description: &quot;A&quot; is for Alice. Love this deck of cards based on Alice Adventures in Wonderland* books and movies.  The photo is less than a credit card size.

*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a young girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre.  The vintage deck cards were printed based on the illustrations of the novel.

Description: Three nights in a row i go walk my back yard each time i come around my shed i get one loud yip from a fox then i hear it run to the back dens .
Last night the same thing so i decided to set up the trail cam
to where i think the yip comes from as its the same place,, night after night ( reminds me of a song ).

Looking for a good tree to put the trail cam on i start looking around and the first thing i notice is the damage done by rabbits and .. some deer. mostly rabbit . I love my rabbits 
but they had trashed some of my prize tree projects and this year seems more damage i ever noticed since we first bought the place .
But i feel kinda a bad when i discovered the spot were i think the fox has been . This spring we had (key word) had, four adult  rabbits now i wonder what its down to now.
Groundhogs sightings about two out of the ten so far but its still early yet. usual skunks but this month its slowing in the sightings .
Cats: even during the winter the roaming neighborhood cats had been a problem but with the now ever present fox or foxes Erika said she had a day time visit by my favorite special Red fox with some frequency and i have seen my usual Gray fox but that was just once around January the Red seems to be now permanent what i haven't noticed yet is cat missing signs  around the neighborhood since last fall up to January 
i've seen five different cats four of them i took images of at my feeding station, so do i think the lull in cat traffic has something to do with the fox's return ?",2021-04-14 10:01:03
