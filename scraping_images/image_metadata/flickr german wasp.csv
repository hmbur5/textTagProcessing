(525th Fighter Transport Squadron)

70th Anniversary Edition (2018)

The Douglas DC-3 (DC – Douglas Commercial) is considered by many as the aircraft that revolutionized commercial air travel in the 20th Century. The maiden flight of the DC-3 took place on December 17, 1935, the 32nd anniversary of the Wright Brother’s historic flight at Kitty Hawk. Now airlines were able to be profitable without depending on U.S. Mail subsidies and passengers could now fly transcontinental with just one re-fueling stop. There are many DC-3s still flying 75 years after their maiden flights.

During the Berlin Airlift that lasted from June 24, 1948 until May 12, 1949 the 86th Fighter Group had chosen a camel as its mascot and flew one in from Libya that they named Clarence. In October 1948 a C-47A with Clarence aboard and designated “Camel Caravan To Berlin” left Neubiberg AB laden with thousands of pounds of candy, games and toys as a good will gesture for the children of Berlin that were caught in the Soviet imposed blockade of the city.

Picture Camel:
Wiesbaden, Germany, October 21, 1948: Clarence the Camel stands in a C-47 aircraft amid some 5,000 pounds of food, candy, books, games and toys on the way to Berlin for distribution to children of the blockaded city during the Berlin Airlift. Clarence — mascot of the pilots of the 86th Fighter Group at Neubiberg Air Force Base — was flown in from Tripoli, Libya, for a tour of the U.S. zone of Germany after the &quot;&quot;camel caravan&quot;&quot; stop in Berlin.

During the Berlin Airlift, the United States Air Force 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Neubiberg air base in West Germany operated a C- 47 Skytrain support aircraft. On 22nd October 1948, as a gift for the children of Berlin, the C-47 was used to fly 7,000lb (3175kg) of Candy, along with a baby Camel called 'Clarence' into Tempelhof airport in the US sector of Berlin. The camel was the mascot of the 525th Fighter Squadron based at Neubiberg and had been bought by a member of the squadron in Tripoli for $50 and shipped to Germany in the bomb bay of a B-26 Invader bomber. When Berlin was besieged the base personnel decided to present both it and the candy to the children as a gesture of goodwill for Christmas.

Douglas C-47 Skytrain:
Designed to meet an American Airlines requirement for an enlarged version of the DC-2, the DC-3 was first flown on December 17th, 1935. Capable of carrying 24 passengers at a cruising speed of 180 mph, the DC-3's speed and long range revolutionized commercial air travel in the 1930s and 40s, when it carried 90 percent of the world's air travelers. Early DC-3s used Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines, but Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp Radials were fitted to later versions; these engines had better single engine performance and allowed the DC-3 to fly at higher altitudes.

Flies, Wasps and Hornets were feeding on rotten fruits, the Hornets also tried to catch wasps and flies to feed the offspring. 
Flies were very cautious and agile and could almost always escape, whereas wasps were caught more often, especially grasped inside the fruits.

Fliegen, Wespen und Hornissen fraßen an den faulen Früchten, die Hornissen versuchten zudem Wespen und Fliegen als Futter für den Nachwuchs zu fangen.
Die Fliegen waren sehr vorsichtig und wendig und konnten fast immer entkommen, Wespen wurden häufiger erwischt, vor allem in den Früchten wurden sie ergriffen.

Description: As World War Two continued, the German military utilized more and more self-propelled artillery though such guns were never able to fully replace horse-drawn or those guns drawn by half-tracks or other soft-skinned vehicles. Of course, for artillery of any kind to be truly effective during the war, it required forward observers who would watch the fall of the rounds and radio back corrections to the firing batteries to ensure that as much of the incoming fire was as close to on-target as possible and thus maximize the destruction. These forward observers were often small teams on foot or moved about the battlefield in lightly armored vehicles such as armored cars or light tanks. By 1943, such vehicles had a very limited lifespan. Typically artillery was used defensively to break up an attack or was used on the offense to soften up the enemy prior to committing ground troops. Either way, it meant the forward observers had to be in the vicinity of the action in order to witness the incoming fire missions and correct as needed. Thus, it was seen that something better was needed to support the self-propelled artillery batteries and give forward observers the means to survive the front lines. The initial answer was the Artillerie-Panzerbeobachtungswagen III (PzBeobWg III).

The Artillery Tank Observation Vehicle III was, in reality, a stop-gap measure which was undertaken to provide such a vehicle while development of a purpose-built armored observation vehicle was conducted (something that did not happen). Using war-weary and obsolete Ausf E through Ausf H models of the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank, several modifications were done to convert them to their new role. The biggest change was the removal of the main gun armament. In place of the main gun, a Maschínengewehr 34 (MG 34) in a ball mounting was fitted and provided with 1,500 rounds of ammunition. The weight savings by not having a main gun nor the associated shells allowed for the fitting of an additional 30mm of armor plate on the hull front and on the entire rear of the tank. In addition, a new gun mantlet replaced the original, increasing the thickness from 30mm to 50mm. A feature of this mantlet was the addition of a dummy gun fitted to the right of the MG 34. The hull machine-gun was removed and the hole for the machine-gun was fitted with a metal plug. For radio equipment to allow communication back to the battery, the PzBeobWg III was fitted with a Funkgerät 4 (FuG 4) and the FuG 8. The FuG 4 utilized a 2 meter tall star antenna though specifics about it are not well known. The FuG 8 was heavily used for divisional communication with later models using a 30 watt transmitter, MW receiver C, and had a frequency band of 835 to 3,000 kilocycles per second. It used a 8 meter tall mast antenna. The FuG 4 had a much shorter range, with a Wireless Telegraph (WT) range of 2.3 miles and a Radiotelephone (RT) range of 1.2 miles. The FuG 8, on the other hand had a WT range of 31.1 miles and a RT range of 6.2 miles. In all, 262 PzBeobWg III vehicles were constructed between February 1943 to April 1944 and two such vehicles were deployed to each Hummel (“Bumblebee”) or Wespe (“Wasp”) self-propelled gun batteries as supply permitted.

The photograph was reportedly taken following the German defeat at the hands of the Soviets following Unternehmen Frühlingserwachen (Operation Spring Awakening) in mid-March 1945 near Lake Balaton, Hungary. If this is accurate, then the PzBeobWg III belonged to 75. Panzer-Artillerie-Regiment underneath the III. Panzerkorps, 6. Armee, Heeresgruppe Süd. This unit was equipped with “Wespe“ 10.5cm self-propelled guns on the Panzerkampfwagen II chassis. It is difficult to assess what model the PzBeobWg III shown was built on but given the late date in the war, it is likely an Ausf H version. The crew had secured three links of track to the front of the tank in an effort to increase the protection. Since the hull machine-gun was not fitted, the track covered where it had been but one can see a portion of the track missing to allow the driver to see through his vision block. Just visible are the Schürzen (armored skirts) fitted to the turret and hull. The front part of the skirt on the hull can be made out to the right (as one looks at the photograph) of the Soviet soldier. The turret skirt is visible just behind the dummy gun mantlet. These skirts were designed to reduce the velocity or divert the trajectory of incoming kinetic rounds. In the upper, right corner of the photograph is the star antenna for the FuG 4 radio. Of interest, however, is the dummy gun itself. The crew of this PzBeobWg III fashioned an entirely new dummy gun and fit it over the existing one. The likely reason for this is because the standard dummy gun gave the appearance of the far weaker short 5cm KwK L/42 or the 3.7cm KwK L/46.5. By adding the additional wooden mantlet sleeve and the longer wooden barrel with a muzzle brake, it gave the PzBeobWg III the appearance of a Panzerkampfwagen IV fitted with the potent 7.5cm KwK40 L/48 gun. This was made moreso by the use of the Schürzen which many late-war PzKpfw IV tanks were equipped with. In so doing, the elaborate wooden dummy gun assembly helped the PzBeobWg III blend in more and not be singled out. Of course, the Soviet soldier hefting the broken gun tube for the camera means it didn't make much of a difference for this PzBeobWg III.",2021-04-05 16:30:23

Physical characteristics

Primaries black with pale edges, breast mauve-pink merging to creamy on belly. Flanks grey, feathers along edge of wing white, forming a band on open wing. Iridescent purple-pink and green feathers beside a white patch on each side or neck, rectrices grey with broad black terminal band. Pale greyish whie central band evident on underside of tail, but less conspicuous on upperside. Iris greenish white to pale golden. Orbital skin grey. Bill purplish pink basally, golden distally, cere white. Legs reddish purple. Races maderensis and azorica duller, with smaller neck patches. Race excelsa tends to be brigther, and iranica has bill whitish to pale yellow. Race casiotis has neck paches creamy buff rather than white.

Habitat

Typically a species of ecotone in deciduous or coniferous woodland, sometimes up to tree-line in the Alps. In C Eurpe breeds on edge of old mixed pine and oke forests. In other places found in ash forests, also inhabits plantantions of exotics notably Sitka spruce and Douglas fir.

Other details

Columba palumbus is a widespread breeder throughout Europe, which constitutes &gt;75% of its global breeding range. Its European breeding population is very large (&gt;9,000,000 pairs), and was stable between 1970-1990. The key populations in Germany and the United Kingdom increased during 1990-2000, and the species increased slightly overall.

Feeding

Most of diet made up of plant matter, including green leaves, buds, flower, seeds, berries and root crops. Various invertebrates are also occasionally eaten, including earthworms, gall wasps, beetles, pupae of lepidoptera, spiders, slugs and snails. Takes most of food from ground, but also feeds in trees.

Breeding

Nest consists of twigs, grasses and leaves. Nest become bulkier with repeated use. Placed up to 3 m above ground in fork of tree or on branch,in a creeper in tree, or rarely on ground in thick vegetation or under a hedge. 1-3 white eggs, incubation 17 days.

Migration

North and East European birds mostly migratory, as are West Siberian populations; species partially migratory or resident in West, Central &amp; South Europe. Populations living in middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco fly daily to plains to feed, although some individuals may forage only 15 m from the nest.             ",2021-04-05 16:30:24

Description: Corralejo (pronounced [koraˈlexo]) is a town and resort located on the northern tip of Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands, facing the smaller islet of Lobos. It is in the municipality of La Oliva. It is surrounded to the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, by dunes to the south and by arid desert land to the west that leads to the western coast and El Cotillo. Once a traditional fishing village, the town has grown significantly and today is one of the two main tourist towns on the island of Fuerteventura. Thanks to the large expat population, the town has a diverse population that varies from the local Spaniard, to the Irish, British, German and Finnish people who have settled in the resort.

Fuerteventura is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean and is part of the North Africa region, politically part of Spain. At 1,659.74 square kilometres (640.83 sq mi), it is the second largest of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife. As at the start of 2019, Fuerteventura had 116,886 inhabitants.[2] It was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in May 2009. Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.

Etymology
The island's name is a compound word formed by the Spanish words for &quot;strong&quot; (fuerte) and &quot;fortune&quot; (ventura). Traditionally, Fuerteventura's name has been regarded as a reference to the strong winds around the island and the resulting danger to nautical adventurers. However, it might have referred instead (or also) to wealth, luck or destiny.

In 1339 the Mallorcan navigator Angelino Dulcert, in the Planisferio de Angelino Dulcert]], referred to the island as &quot;Forte Ventura&quot;.[3][4][5]

Another theory is that the island's name derives from &quot;Fortunatae Insulae&quot; (Fortunate Islands), the name by which the Romans knew the Canary Islands.[6]

The indigenous name of the island, before its conquest in the 15th century, was Erbania, divided into two regions (Jandía and Maxorata), from which the name majorero (originally majo or maxo) derives. However, it has been suggested that, at some point, Maxorata (which meant &quot;the children of the country&quot;) was the aboriginal toponym of the entire island.[7]

History

Morro Jable
Precolonial history

The two kingdoms of the Precolonial Fuerteventura, Jandía and Maxorata
The first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa. The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as Planaria, in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.

Phoenician settlers landed in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.

Several Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the islands were organized around 1340, followed by Moors and European slave traders. At the end of the Iberian conquest, the island was divided into two Guanches kingdoms, one adhering to King Guize and the other to King Ayoze. The territories of these kingdoms were called Maxorata (in the North) and Jandía (in the South) respectively. They were separated by a wall, which traversed the La Pared isthmus. Some remains have been preserved. The ancient name for the island, Erbania, is derived from this wall's name.[8]

The conquest
The island's conquest began in earnest in 1402, commanded by French knights and crusaders Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle.[9] They arrived with only 63 sailors out of the original 283, as many had deserted along the way. After arriving and settling in Lanzarote, the invaders made some first excursions to the neighboring islands. In 1404, Bethencourt and Gadifer founded Betancuria, on the West coast, the first settlement on the island. After numerous difficulties, Gadifer took charge of the invasion, while Bethencourt returned to Spain to seek the recognition and support of the Castilian king.


Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, Betancuria
In 1405, de Béthencourt completed his conquest of the island, establishing its capital in Betancuria (Puerto Rosario took over the mantle as island capital in 1835).

In 1424 Pope Martin V, through the Betancuria Brief, edicted the establishment of the Bishopric of Fuerteventura, which encompassed all the Canary Islands save for the island of Lanzarote.[10] The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the Great Schism (1378–1417), in that the bishop of San Marcial del Rubicón of Lanzarote (at the time, the only diocese in the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, and instead adhered to anti-Pope Benedict XIII. The Bishopric of Fuerteventura was based in the Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, bestowing upon the latter the status of Grant Cathedral. After the reabsorbtion of the Diocese of San Marcial del Rubicón by the papacy of Pope of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished in 1431, only seven years after it was created.[10]

The first census[when?] recorded a population of some 1,200 inhabitants. The population increased gradually thereafter. In 1476 the territory became the Señorío Territorial de Fuerteventura, subjected to the Catholic Monarchs.[11] In later years, the island was invaded by the Spanish, French and the English.

2nd conquest of Fuerteventura
Over time, the island endured numerous pirate raids. A Berber-led expedition invaded in 1593, sweeping as far inland as the capital. Various castles were built along the coastline, to protect against these type of attacks. The population was moved inland as a second protective measure. Because of the raids, a first Captain General was dispatched to Fuerteventura, accompanied by a number of Sergeant Majors, to defend the island in the name of the Crown. At that time Betancuria became the religious capital of the island.[12]

Two major pirate attacks took place in 1740, within a month of each other. Two separate bands of English privateers attempted to loot the town of Tuineje. These attacks were however successfully averted by the local population and the island's militia. This successful repelling of the invaders is celebrated at a re-enactment that takes place in Gran Tarajal every year in October.[13]

The island's garrison was officially instated in 1708. Its colonel assumed the title of Governor at Arms, a hereditary, lifelong appointment which has remained in the Sánchez-Dumpiérrez family. In time, this family increasingly garnered power over the other islands through alliances with the family of Arias de Saavedra and the Lady of Fuerteventura.[14] During the same year the Assistant Parish of La Oliva and Pájara was created, to become operational in 1711. On 17 December 1790 the Assistant Parish of Tuineje was created, which became a new parish division on 23 June 1792 under the bishop Tavira, with lands including part of the Jandía peninsular, and with a population of 1,670 inhabitants. 1780 saw the start of a barrilla plantation industry.[15]

To the present
In 1852, a free trade zone was extended by Isabella II to the Canary Islands. Military island rule, which began in 1708, was finally dissolved in 1859, and Puerto de Cabras (now Puerto del Rosario) became the new capital.


Caleta de Fuste and its castle
The Canary Islands obtained self-governance in 1912. In 1927, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote became part of the province of Gran Canaria. The seat of the island's government (cabildo insular) is located in Puerto del Rosario. A total of 118,574 people lived on the island in 2018.

By the 1940s the island had an airport (just west of Puerto del Rosario on the road to Tindaya, still visible today). Mass tourism began to arrive in the mid-1960s, facilitated by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral and the first tourist hotels.[16]

The island's proximity (a mere 100 km) to the West African coast and the fact that it is part of the Schengen territory make it a prime target destination for undocumented immigrants. However, many have perished while attempting the crossing.[17]

Flag of Fuerteventura

Flag of Fuerteventura
The flag of Fuerteventura is in proportions 1:2, divided vertically, green to the hoist and white to the fly end, with the coat of arms of the island in the centre.

Coat of Arms
The coat of arms of Fuerteventura was prescribed by a Decree adopted on 15 October 1998 by the Government of the Canary Islands and published on 11 November 1998 in the official gazette of the Canary Islands, No. 142, pp. 13,432–13,433. It was adopted on 24 April 1998 by the Island Council and validated on 18 September 1998 by the Heraldry Commission of the Canary Islands.

The heraldic description is &quot;per pale and per fess. First, gules, a castle or, masoned sable, its gate and windows azure. Second, argent, lion gules, crowned, armed and langued or. Third, silver, three fesses chequy gules and or, in four rows, each one charged with a fess or. Bordure gules, with eight saltires or. Ensigned with a royal crown, open.&quot;

According to José Manuel Erbez (Banderas y escudos de Canarias, 2007), the coat of arms is based on the arms of the island's provincial militia. The upper quarters represent Castile (symbolized by a castle) and León (symbolized by a lion). The lower quarter alludes to the Saavedra family; various members of this family were lords of Fuerteventura. [18][19]

Geography

Barranco de Pecenescal
Environment

Euphorbia regis-jubae, food plant of Hyles tithymali
The elongated island has an area of 1,660 km2 (641 sq mi). The island is 100 kilometres (62 miles) long and 31 kilometres (19 miles) wide. It is part of the province of Las Palmas. It is divided into six municipalities:

Antigua
Betancuria
La Oliva
Pájara
Puerto del Rosario
Tuineje
100 individual settlements are distributed through these municipalities. A nearby islet, Islote de Lobos, is part of the municipality of La Oliva.

Located just 100 km (62 mi) off the coast of North Africa, it is the second biggest of the islands, after Tenerife, and has the longest white sand beaches in the archipelago. The island is a destination for sun, beach and watersports enthusiasts. It lies at the same latitude as Florida and Mexico and temperatures rarely fall below 18 °C (64 °F) or rise above 32 °C (90 °F). It counts 152 separate beaches along its seaboard — 50 km (31 mi) of white sand and 25 km (16 mi) of black volcanic shingle.

The highest point in Fuerteventura is Pico de la Zarza (807 m) in the southwestern part of the island. Geographical features include Istmo de la Pared which is 5 km (3 mi) wide and is the narrowest part of Fuerteventura. The island is divided into two parts, the northern portion which is Maxorata and the southwestern part called the Jandía peninsula.

Climate
The climate on Fuerteventura is pleasant throughout the year. The island is hence referred to as the island of eternal spring. The sea regulates air temperature, diverting hot Sahara winds away from the island. The island's name in English translates as &quot;strong fortune&quot; or &quot;strong wind&quot;, the Spanish word for wind being viento. During the winter months, temperatures average a high of 22 °C (72 °F) and a low of around 15 °C (59 °F), whereas during the summer a mean high of 28 °C (82 °F) and a low of 20 °C (68 °F) can be expected. Precipitation is about 147 mm (6 in) per year, most of which falls in autumn and winter. December is the month with highest rainfall.

A sandstorm known as the Calima (similar to the Sirocco wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between 100 to 200 m (328.08 to 656.17 ft) or even lower, and together with very warm temperatures, it can even bring African locusts to the island.


Hydrology
In the winter months, up to 80% of the rainwater flows unused into the ocean, as there is no vegetation to capture the water (also due to overgrazing by free-ranging goats near the coast). The mountain forests, which were still present in the 19th century, were all chopped down. Instead, there are many desalination plants (running on electricity) which produce the required amount of freshwater on the island. The tourists on the island use about double the amount of water as the native inhabitants of Fuerteventura. Causes are the filling of swimming pools, watering hotel gardens and washing towels, ...[21]

Geology
Fuerteventura is the oldest island in the Canary Islands dating back 20 million years to a volcanic eruption from the Canary hotspot.[22] The majority of the island was created about 5 million years ago and since then has been eroded by wind and precipitation. On the seabed off the West coast of the island rests an enormous slab of bedrock 22 km (14 mi) long and 11 km (7 mi) wide, which appears to have slid off the island largely intact at some point in prehistory, similar to the predicted future collapse of Cumbre Vieja, a geological fault on another Canary Island, La Palma. The last volcanic activity in Fuerteventura occurred between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.

Beaches

The black-sand beach at Ajuy
Fuerteventura was chosen among 500 European destinations by the Quality Coast International Certification Program of the European Coastal and Marine Union as one of the most attractive tourist destinations for visitors interested in cultural heritage, environment and sustainability. The best beaches to visit are Playas de Corralejo, Playa de Ajuy, Playa de Cofete and Playas de El Cotillo.[23]

The island is home to one of the two surviving populations of the threatened Canarian Egyptian vulture. It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the collared dove, common swifts and several finch species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.

Despite its arid climate, the island is also home to a surprisingly large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (Colias hyale) and the bath white (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor (Anax imperator) and the scarlet darter (Crocothemis erythraea) can be found. The island's sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).

Hawkmoths also occur on the island. One of the more notable species is Hyles tithymali which feeds on endemic spurges such as Euphorbia regis-jubae. Acherontia atropos, the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the Solanaceae, for example, Datura innoxia and Nicotiana glauca which are common weeds in the vicinity of human habitation.

Demographics

Population
The island has a population of 116,886.[2] Throughout its long history, Fuerteventura has suffered from a population decline due to the economic situation and the climate, which have made it into a desert island. However, the development of tourism during the 1980s has caused the population to grow year on year since then, doubling it in a little less than a decade.

In 2005, with 86,642 registered inhabitants,[25] the Fuerteventura population was formed by the following:

Born on the island: 30,364
Born on another Canary Island: 13,175
Born elsewhere in Spain: 20,938
Born in other countries: 22,165
Comparing this data with the 2001 census shows that the number of permanent residents born on the island has increased by just 3,000. The number who have moved in from abroad has increased by 22,910, making this the biggest contributor to population growth in recent years.[26]

Education
The island has 116 schools,[27] with a total of 14,337 pupils.[28] Of these, 45 are primary schools, ten are secondary schools, six are for Baccalaureate students and four are vocational colleges.[29]

Fuerteventura also has a centre linked with the National University of Distance Education, offering courses in many subjects including economics, business studies, law, history and tourism.[30]

State administration
Fuerteventura is governed by the Island Department of the Government of Spain, which holds the rank of a Government Subdepartment. The government building is located in the centre of the capital city.

This institution is charged with representing the Government of Spain on the island, and managing all the functions that are not under control of the Canarian Government. This includes the following public services:

Island Security Forces (National Police and Guardia Civil)
Puerto del Rosario port and Fuerteventura Airport
Tax Agency
Customs
the Maritime and Coastguard department
Driving licences, Traffic and Highways
Immigration – the Immigration Detention Centre and residential permits
Social Security
Red Cross
Seprona (the Nature Protection Service)
Passports
Since 30 June 2007, the island's governor has been Eustaquio Juan Santana Gil.[31] 4

Island Council of Fuerteventura (Cabildo)
The councils, formed as part of the Councils Act of 1912, administer the Canary Islands and have two principal functions. On one hand, they perform services for the Autonomous Community, and on the other, they are the local government centre for the island. In the 2003 elections, Mario Cabrera González was elected as president representing the Canarian Coalition, with 31.02% of the votes, followed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 27.53%, represented by the Vice President Domingo Fuentes Curbelo.

Municipalities

City Council of Puerto del Rosario
The island is divided into six municipalities with their respective city councils which form part of the FECAM (Federation of Canarian Municipalities). They are governed by the basic legislation of the local regime and their respective organic rules. The populations of the municipalities are as follows:

NameArea
(km2)Population

In turn, these municipalities are organised into two associations: the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Norte de Fuerteventura formed from La Oliva and Puerto del Rosario, and the remaining municipalities make up the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Sur de Fuerteventura.[35]

Economy
Both Fuerteventura and Lanzarote would be the main exporters of wheat and cereals to the central islands of the archipelago during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries; Tenerife and Gran Canaria.[36] Although this trade almost never reversed in the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (due to the fact that the landowners of these islands profited from this activity), producing periods of famine, so the population of these islands He had to travel to Tenerife and Gran Canaria to try to improve his luck. Being the island of Tenerife as the main focus of attraction for the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, hence the feeling of union that has always existed in the popular sphere with Tenerife.[36]

The economy of Fuerteventura is mainly based on tourism. Primary tourist areas are located around the existing towns of Corralejo in the north and Morro Jable in Jandia, plus the purely tourist development of Caleta de Fuste, south of Puerto del Rosario. Other main industries are fishing and agriculture (cereals and vegetables). The famous Majorero cheese is locally made from the milk of the indigenous majorera goat.

In 2009, Fuerteventura recorded the highest EU regional unemployment rate at a NUTS3 level, at 29.2 percent.[37]

Tourism

Fuerteventura coastline
The first tourist hotel was built in 1965 followed by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral, heralding the dawn of a new era for the island. Fuerteventura, with its 3,000 sunshine hours a year, was placed firmly on the world stage as a major European holiday destination.[38] While having fully developed tourist facilities, the island has not experienced the overdevelopment found on some other islands.[citation needed] Nonetheless, it remains a destination for predominantly but not exclusively European tourists.[39]

The summer Trade Winds and winter swells of the Atlantic make this a year-round surfers' paradise, with more exposed areas on the north and west shores such as Corralejo and El Cotillo proving most popular. Wind surfing takes places at locations around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.[40]

Excellent sandy beaches are found in many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can experience strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of Corralejo are popular, as are the more protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between Costa Calma and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.[citation needed]

Much of the interior, with its large plains, lavascapes and volcanic mountains, consists of protected areas, although there are organised tours and vehicular access across them.

Like the rest of the Canaries, Carnival is traditionally one of the biggest festivals celebrated on the island. It is celebrated in different ways in all the towns during February and March. These festivities have a different theme each year. They include activities such as parades and galas to choose the carnival king.

Concerts and festivals

King África in Puerto del Rosario in 2000
There are many concerts and festivals held in the auditoriums, such as the Festival of Canarian Music. They are also held in smaller venues across the island, featuring bands such as Estopa, Van Gogh's Ear, and King Afrhica.

Lebrancho Rock: in 2004, the Town Hall of Puerto del Rosario started this initiative for the growing number of local bands who had been performing in the area for years but had not had the chance to play at the same event.
Fuertemusica: like Lebrancho Rock, this festival aims to encourage the local or emerging groups. It started in the same year. This festival is mainly for groups that are already known in the music world. It takes place in El Cotillo.
In the municipality of Betancuria (more specifically in the village of Vega de Rio Palmas) held every year the festivities in honor of the Virgen de la Peña, patron saint of the island of Fuerteventura, the most representative is the pilgrimage in which are involved people from all corners of the island. The holiday is celebrated on the third Saturday of September.
Festival Internacional de Cometas/International Kite Festival is held on the second week of November each year centering on the Corralejo Beaches. It attracts kitefliers and kite surfers from all over Europe. It is popular because the winds are warm and constant and the beaches become filled with hundreds of colourful kites of all shapes and sizes.[41]

Auditoriums

Central library
The Central Library of the Island is located in Antigua's city centre, in the public university. In addition to providing the traditional library services, it has a 180-seat multipurpose room, air conditioning, a wifi zone, and a multimedia room used for seminars, presentations, film festivals etc.

Museums and exhibition spaces

The museum in Betancuria
The island has several museums with different themes and plenty of exhibition spaces, both public and private. These include:

The Antigua Windmill Craft Centre
The Salt Museum
The Atalayita Archeological Interpretation Centre
Sculpture park
In addition to the museums, the capital Puerto del Rosario has an open-air sculpture park consisting of around 100 sculptures by different artists scattered across the city. Most of them were created for the International Symposium of Sculpture celebrated annually since 2001. During the festival, artists come from all over the world to erect their sculptures in the open air, in full view of passers by.

Main sights
Sites of interest include Corralejo and El Jable to the north which are made up of fine sand dunes whilst the south is filled with long beaches and remote bays. The constant winds blowing onto the beaches provide a paradise for windsurfing. Surfing is common on the west and north coasts where there are large waves. Windsurfing is common around Corralejo and Playas de Sotavento and wave sailing (windsurfing on the waves) on the coast along the northern half of the island. El Cotillo is a small fishing village in the north-west of the Island famous for a very long beach to the south of the village and few very calm beaches to the north. The northern beaches frequented by snorkeling enthusiasts and sun worshippers alike are referred to as lakes by the locals.


The wreck of American Star (SS America) seen in July 2004 from land side
At Cofete on the western side of Jandía a remote and imposing house – Villa Winter – looks out to sea across wide beaches. It was reputedly built by a Mr Winter on land given by Generalisimo Franco.

For a time, the beaches were home to a popular accidental attraction. On 18 January 1994 the United States Lines ocean liner SS American Star (former America, USS West Point, Australis) was beached in Playa de Garcey during a severe storm. Within a year, she broke in two and later lost her stern. By 2007 the rest of the severely deteriorated ship had collapsed onto her port side, gradually keeling over further and almost completely submerged. By 2008–2012, most of the remains finally slipped below the surface.

Food

Majorera cheese
The cuisine is fairly basic due to the customs and climate conditions. They share this simplicity with the other Canary islands, and similarly to them, they use a large quantity of fish. They also use whatever they can grow in the near-barren land. This includes papas arrugadas, a dish of wrinkled potatoes usually served with mojo, which is a hot pepper sauce or with puchero canario, a meat stew.

Seafood is prepared in many ways traditionally, such as pejines (salted fish),[42] jareas,[43] or sancocho (a type of stew) made from fish, generally the grouper,[44] corvina or sama, boiled after salting, and served with mojo, potatoes, or gofio (a type of grain). People are also very keen on the mussels and limpets collected on the island's coasts.

They also use meat such as beef and pork to make different dishes or simply to for braising, but their main meat is goat, both from the kids and from the older animals. They eat the goat roasted or stewed. Goats are not only useful for their meat – the Fuerteventurans also use the milk to make the cheese majorero, which has won many prizes. The majorero is mostly made of goats milk, and occasionally it is up to 15% ewes milk. It is cured in pimento oil or gofio meal. Majorero and palmero cheese are the only two Canarian cheeses with protected denomination of origin.

Sport
Many sports are commonly played in Fuerteventura, both in the open air and in sports centres across the island.

Native sports
These are the Canarian sports found on the island:

Canarian wrestling
The wrestling takes place in a ring of sand called the terrero. Inside it, the two contestants try to knock each other over. Fuerteventura has 14 terreros distributed through all the towns except Betancuria.

Antigua: Terrero de Antigua.
La Oliva: Terrero Venancio Guerra and Terrero de Villaverde.
Pájara: Terrero Miguel Díaz La Lajita, Terrero de Morro Jable a Terrero de Pájara.
Puerto del Rosario: Terrero de Casillas del Angel, Terrero Manuel Nieves, Terrero de Puerto Cabras, Terrero de Tefía a Terrero de Tetir.
Tuineje: Terrero de Gran Tarajal, Terrero de Tamasite, and Terrero Pedro Sánchez in Tarajalejo.
The island also has a school wrestling league organized by the council and a programme to promote this sport in clubs. Twelve wrestling schools participate in this, based in Antigua, Costa Calma, El Matorral, La Lajita, Lajares, Las Playitas, Morro Jable, Puerto del Rosario, Tefía, Tetir, Unión Sur and Villaverde.

Juego del Palo

An exhibition during FEDETUR 2000, in Pozo Negro (Antigua) on 23 September 2000
Juego del Palo is a Canarian martial art which literally translates as &quot;game of the stick&quot;. It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All we know is that it is based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.

Fuerteventura has the following Palo clubs:[45]

Club-Escuela Dunas de Corralejo.
Club-Escuela Huriamen de Villaverde.
Club-Escuela Puerto Cabras.
Club-Escuela Sorinque de Gran Tarajal.
Canarian boules
This is a similar game to the French Pétanque which is actually played very little on the island, although there are a few teams and courts. Basically the game consists of scoring points by throwing a ball to get it as near as possible to an object called a mingue or boliche. It is played on a rectangular sand or earth pitch which is 18 to 25 metres (59.1–82.0 feet) long and 3.5 to 6 metres (11.5–19.7 feet) wide.

Watersports
The sea and climate conditions make the island the perfect place for a huge variety of watersports.

Surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing

Windsurfing in Corralejo
Many types of surfing are popular on the island, including traditional surfing, windsurfing (where the board is propelled by a sail) and most recently kitesurfing. The island has many schools and courses dedicated to teaching these sports.

The sports where Fuerteventura has the most impact internationally are windsurfing and kitesurfing, mainly due to the International Windsurfing and Kiteboarding Championship. This has run since 1985 and is held at Playas de Sotavento in Pájara municipality. Many important wind and kitesurfing figures compete in this championship, such as the several-times world windsurfing champion Björn Dunkerbeck and Gisela Pulido, the very young kiteboarding champion from Tarifa.

Many Canarian windsurfers are on the Canarian Waveriders circuit, which has been based in Corralejo since 2005.

Diving
Diving schools are just as frequent as surfing ones, all around the coast of Fuerteventura. Unlike the other islands of the archipelago, Fuerteventura has a shelf which at some points goes up to 30 kilometres (19 miles), making it an ideal place to practice this sport.

Two of the most useful points for diving are the coast off Playa del Matorral in the South, and the zone between Lobos Island and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo – Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, professional dives, lessons in underwater photography, screenings and other events related to the sport.

Swimming
There are many swimming pools on the island but the most obvious place to swim is in the open sea. There is an annual swim from Lobos Island to Fuerteventura, held every year since 1999. The event attracts amateur swimmers from all over the Canaries and Spain, and also swimming professionals such as David Meca and Maarten van der Weijden, the paralympist Jesús Collado Alarcón who won gold medals for 100m backstroke and butterfly in Athens 2004, and Xavi Torres Ramis, the paralympic champion in Barcelona 1992, Sydney and Atlanta.

Sailing

The harbour at Caleta de Fuste (Antigua)
The island holds competitions involving different types of boat, such as the lateen and the Optimist. An interesting event is the Tour of Fuerteventura by Kayak, which is organised as a series of stages rather than a competition, and is an easy way to explore the island.

Fishing
The most notable competition here is the Gran Tarajal Fishing Open.

Other sports
Since 2004 the Marcha Ciclotourista has been held in La Oliva and the Criterium Ciclista has been held in Corralejo (also part of the La Oliva municipality) since 2005. Participants include Euskaltel–Euskadi, T-Mobile and a team from Orbea. These competitions have contributed to local interest in the sport and the first professional local team, the Fuerteventura-Canarias, was formed, initially run by Óscar Guerrero, director of Kaiku, although they have not competed for the past few seasons.

There are various motocross circuits on the island, including Los Alares in Antigua and Isla de Fuerteventura in Puerto del Rosario municipality. They hold regular trials, some of which form part of the Canarian Regional Motocross Championship. Throughout the year there are gravel rally races. Two are part of the Canarian Dirt Rally Championship. These are the Antiguan Rally and the La Oliva Rally.

The island's main football clubs are CD Union Puerto and CD Cotillo, who play in Group XII of the Spanish Tercera División.

The resort Playitas on the south coast is since around 2008 equipped with a 50-metre (160-foot) swimming pool and has become a destination for triathlon training camps for Europeans. An annual race called Challenge Fuerteventura is held there on the half ironman distance.

Description: Corralejo (pronounced [koraˈlexo]) is a town and resort located on the northern tip of Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands, facing the smaller islet of Lobos. It is in the municipality of La Oliva. It is surrounded to the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, by dunes to the south and by arid desert land to the west that leads to the western coast and El Cotillo. Once a traditional fishing village, the town has grown significantly and today is one of the two main tourist towns on the island of Fuerteventura. Thanks to the large expat population, the town has a diverse population that varies from the local Spaniard, to the Irish, British, German and Finnish people who have settled in the resort.

Fuerteventura is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean and is part of the North Africa region, politically part of Spain. At 1,659.74 square kilometres (640.83 sq mi), it is the second largest of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife. As at the start of 2019, Fuerteventura had 116,886 inhabitants.[2] It was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in May 2009. Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.

Etymology
The island's name is a compound word formed by the Spanish words for &quot;strong&quot; (fuerte) and &quot;fortune&quot; (ventura). Traditionally, Fuerteventura's name has been regarded as a reference to the strong winds around the island and the resulting danger to nautical adventurers. However, it might have referred instead (or also) to wealth, luck or destiny.

In 1339 the Mallorcan navigator Angelino Dulcert, in the Planisferio de Angelino Dulcert]], referred to the island as &quot;Forte Ventura&quot;.[3][4][5]

Another theory is that the island's name derives from &quot;Fortunatae Insulae&quot; (Fortunate Islands), the name by which the Romans knew the Canary Islands.[6]

The indigenous name of the island, before its conquest in the 15th century, was Erbania, divided into two regions (Jandía and Maxorata), from which the name majorero (originally majo or maxo) derives. However, it has been suggested that, at some point, Maxorata (which meant &quot;the children of the country&quot;) was the aboriginal toponym of the entire island.[7]

History

Morro Jable
Precolonial history

The two kingdoms of the Precolonial Fuerteventura, Jandía and Maxorata
The first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa. The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as Planaria, in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.

Phoenician settlers landed in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.

Several Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the islands were organized around 1340, followed by Moors and European slave traders. At the end of the Iberian conquest, the island was divided into two Guanches kingdoms, one adhering to King Guize and the other to King Ayoze. The territories of these kingdoms were called Maxorata (in the North) and Jandía (in the South) respectively. They were separated by a wall, which traversed the La Pared isthmus. Some remains have been preserved. The ancient name for the island, Erbania, is derived from this wall's name.[8]

The conquest
The island's conquest began in earnest in 1402, commanded by French knights and crusaders Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle.[9] They arrived with only 63 sailors out of the original 283, as many had deserted along the way. After arriving and settling in Lanzarote, the invaders made some first excursions to the neighboring islands. In 1404, Bethencourt and Gadifer founded Betancuria, on the West coast, the first settlement on the island. After numerous difficulties, Gadifer took charge of the invasion, while Bethencourt returned to Spain to seek the recognition and support of the Castilian king.


Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, Betancuria
In 1405, de Béthencourt completed his conquest of the island, establishing its capital in Betancuria (Puerto Rosario took over the mantle as island capital in 1835).

In 1424 Pope Martin V, through the Betancuria Brief, edicted the establishment of the Bishopric of Fuerteventura, which encompassed all the Canary Islands save for the island of Lanzarote.[10] The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the Great Schism (1378–1417), in that the bishop of San Marcial del Rubicón of Lanzarote (at the time, the only diocese in the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, and instead adhered to anti-Pope Benedict XIII. The Bishopric of Fuerteventura was based in the Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, bestowing upon the latter the status of Grant Cathedral. After the reabsorbtion of the Diocese of San Marcial del Rubicón by the papacy of Pope of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished in 1431, only seven years after it was created.[10]

The first census[when?] recorded a population of some 1,200 inhabitants. The population increased gradually thereafter. In 1476 the territory became the Señorío Territorial de Fuerteventura, subjected to the Catholic Monarchs.[11] In later years, the island was invaded by the Spanish, French and the English.

2nd conquest of Fuerteventura
Over time, the island endured numerous pirate raids. A Berber-led expedition invaded in 1593, sweeping as far inland as the capital. Various castles were built along the coastline, to protect against these type of attacks. The population was moved inland as a second protective measure. Because of the raids, a first Captain General was dispatched to Fuerteventura, accompanied by a number of Sergeant Majors, to defend the island in the name of the Crown. At that time Betancuria became the religious capital of the island.[12]

Two major pirate attacks took place in 1740, within a month of each other. Two separate bands of English privateers attempted to loot the town of Tuineje. These attacks were however successfully averted by the local population and the island's militia. This successful repelling of the invaders is celebrated at a re-enactment that takes place in Gran Tarajal every year in October.[13]

The island's garrison was officially instated in 1708. Its colonel assumed the title of Governor at Arms, a hereditary, lifelong appointment which has remained in the Sánchez-Dumpiérrez family. In time, this family increasingly garnered power over the other islands through alliances with the family of Arias de Saavedra and the Lady of Fuerteventura.[14] During the same year the Assistant Parish of La Oliva and Pájara was created, to become operational in 1711. On 17 December 1790 the Assistant Parish of Tuineje was created, which became a new parish division on 23 June 1792 under the bishop Tavira, with lands including part of the Jandía peninsular, and with a population of 1,670 inhabitants. 1780 saw the start of a barrilla plantation industry.[15]

To the present
In 1852, a free trade zone was extended by Isabella II to the Canary Islands. Military island rule, which began in 1708, was finally dissolved in 1859, and Puerto de Cabras (now Puerto del Rosario) became the new capital.


Caleta de Fuste and its castle
The Canary Islands obtained self-governance in 1912. In 1927, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote became part of the province of Gran Canaria. The seat of the island's government (cabildo insular) is located in Puerto del Rosario. A total of 118,574 people lived on the island in 2018.

By the 1940s the island had an airport (just west of Puerto del Rosario on the road to Tindaya, still visible today). Mass tourism began to arrive in the mid-1960s, facilitated by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral and the first tourist hotels.[16]

The island's proximity (a mere 100 km) to the West African coast and the fact that it is part of the Schengen territory make it a prime target destination for undocumented immigrants. However, many have perished while attempting the crossing.[17]

Flag of Fuerteventura

Flag of Fuerteventura
The flag of Fuerteventura is in proportions 1:2, divided vertically, green to the hoist and white to the fly end, with the coat of arms of the island in the centre.

Coat of Arms
The coat of arms of Fuerteventura was prescribed by a Decree adopted on 15 October 1998 by the Government of the Canary Islands and published on 11 November 1998 in the official gazette of the Canary Islands, No. 142, pp. 13,432–13,433. It was adopted on 24 April 1998 by the Island Council and validated on 18 September 1998 by the Heraldry Commission of the Canary Islands.

The heraldic description is &quot;per pale and per fess. First, gules, a castle or, masoned sable, its gate and windows azure. Second, argent, lion gules, crowned, armed and langued or. Third, silver, three fesses chequy gules and or, in four rows, each one charged with a fess or. Bordure gules, with eight saltires or. Ensigned with a royal crown, open.&quot;

According to José Manuel Erbez (Banderas y escudos de Canarias, 2007), the coat of arms is based on the arms of the island's provincial militia. The upper quarters represent Castile (symbolized by a castle) and León (symbolized by a lion). The lower quarter alludes to the Saavedra family; various members of this family were lords of Fuerteventura. [18][19]

Geography

Environment

Euphorbia regis-jubae, food plant of Hyles tithymali
The elongated island has an area of 1,660 km2 (641 sq mi). The island is 100 kilometres (62 miles) long and 31 kilometres (19 miles) wide. It is part of the province of Las Palmas. It is divided into six municipalities:

Antigua
Betancuria
La Oliva
Pájara
Puerto del Rosario
Tuineje
100 individual settlements are distributed through these municipalities. A nearby islet, Islote de Lobos, is part of the municipality of La Oliva.

Located just 100 km (62 mi) off the coast of North Africa, it is the second biggest of the islands, after Tenerife, and has the longest white sand beaches in the archipelago. The island is a destination for sun, beach and watersports enthusiasts. It lies at the same latitude as Florida and Mexico and temperatures rarely fall below 18 °C (64 °F) or rise above 32 °C (90 °F). It counts 152 separate beaches along its seaboard — 50 km (31 mi) of white sand and 25 km (16 mi) of black volcanic shingle.

The highest point in Fuerteventura is Pico de la Zarza (807 m) in the southwestern part of the island. Geographical features include Istmo de la Pared which is 5 km (3 mi) wide and is the narrowest part of Fuerteventura. The island is divided into two parts, the northern portion which is Maxorata and the southwestern part called the Jandía peninsula.

Climate
The climate on Fuerteventura is pleasant throughout the year. The island is hence referred to as the island of eternal spring. The sea regulates air temperature, diverting hot Sahara winds away from the island. The island's name in English translates as &quot;strong fortune&quot; or &quot;strong wind&quot;, the Spanish word for wind being viento. During the winter months, temperatures average a high of 22 °C (72 °F) and a low of around 15 °C (59 °F), whereas during the summer a mean high of 28 °C (82 °F) and a low of 20 °C (68 °F) can be expected. Precipitation is about 147 mm (6 in) per year, most of which falls in autumn and winter. December is the month with highest rainfall.

A sandstorm known as the Calima (similar to the Sirocco wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between 100 to 200 m (328.08 to 656.17 ft) or even lower, and together with very warm temperatures, it can even bring African locusts to the island.


Hydrology
In the winter months, up to 80% of the rainwater flows unused into the ocean, as there is no vegetation to capture the water (also due to overgrazing by free-ranging goats near the coast). The mountain forests, which were still present in the 19th century, were all chopped down. Instead, there are many desalination plants (running on electricity) which produce the required amount of freshwater on the island. The tourists on the island use about double the amount of water as the native inhabitants of Fuerteventura. Causes are the filling of swimming pools, watering hotel gardens and washing towels, ...[21]

Geology
Fuerteventura is the oldest island in the Canary Islands dating back 20 million years to a volcanic eruption from the Canary hotspot.[22] The majority of the island was created about 5 million years ago and since then has been eroded by wind and precipitation. On the seabed off the West coast of the island rests an enormous slab of bedrock 22 km (14 mi) long and 11 km (7 mi) wide, which appears to have slid off the island largely intact at some point in prehistory, similar to the predicted future collapse of Cumbre Vieja, a geological fault on another Canary Island, La Palma. The last volcanic activity in Fuerteventura occurred between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.

Beaches

The black-sand beach at Ajuy
Fuerteventura was chosen among 500 European destinations by the Quality Coast International Certification Program of the European Coastal and Marine Union as one of the most attractive tourist destinations for visitors interested in cultural heritage, environment and sustainability. The best beaches to visit are Playas de Corralejo, Playa de Ajuy, Playa de Cofete and Playas de El Cotillo.[23]

The island is home to one of the two surviving populations of the threatened Canarian Egyptian vulture. It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the collared dove, common swifts and several finch species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.

Despite its arid climate, the island is also home to a surprisingly large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (Colias hyale) and the bath white (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor (Anax imperator) and the scarlet darter (Crocothemis erythraea) can be found. The island's sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).

Hawkmoths also occur on the island. One of the more notable species is Hyles tithymali which feeds on endemic spurges such as Euphorbia regis-jubae. Acherontia atropos, the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the Solanaceae, for example, Datura innoxia and Nicotiana glauca which are common weeds in the vicinity of human habitation.

Natural symbols

Demographics

Population
The island has a population of 116,886.[2] Throughout its long history, Fuerteventura has suffered from a population decline due to the economic situation and the climate, which have made it into a desert island. However, the development of tourism during the 1980s has caused the population to grow year on year since then, doubling it in a little less than a decade.

In 2005, with 86,642 registered inhabitants,[25] the Fuerteventura population was formed by the following:

Born on the island: 30,364
Born on another Canary Island: 13,175
Born elsewhere in Spain: 20,938
Born in other countries: 22,165
Comparing this data with the 2001 census shows that the number of permanent residents born on the island has increased by just 3,000. The number who have moved in from abroad has increased by 22,910, making this the biggest contributor to population growth in recent years.[26]

Education
The island has 116 schools,[27] with a total of 14,337 pupils.[28] Of these, 45 are primary schools, ten are secondary schools, six are for Baccalaureate students and four are vocational colleges.[29]

Fuerteventura also has a centre linked with the National University of Distance Education, offering courses in many subjects including economics, business studies, law, history and tourism.[30]

State administration
Fuerteventura is governed by the Island Department of the Government of Spain, which holds the rank of a Government Subdepartment. The government building is located in the centre of the capital city.

This institution is charged with representing the Government of Spain on the island, and managing all the functions that are not under control of the Canarian Government. This includes the following public services:

Island Security Forces (National Police and Guardia Civil)
Puerto del Rosario port and Fuerteventura Airport
Tax Agency
Customs
the Maritime and Coastguard department
Driving licences, Traffic and Highways
Immigration – the Immigration Detention Centre and residential permits
Social Security
Red Cross
Seprona (the Nature Protection Service)
Passports
Since 30 June 2007, the island's governor has been Eustaquio Juan Santana Gil.[31] 4

Island Council of Fuerteventura (Cabildo)
The councils, formed as part of the Councils Act of 1912, administer the Canary Islands and have two principal functions. On one hand, they perform services for the Autonomous Community, and on the other, they are the local government centre for the island. In the 2003 elections, Mario Cabrera González was elected as president representing the Canarian Coalition, with 31.02% of the votes, followed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 27.53%, represented by the Vice President Domingo Fuentes Curbelo.

Municipalities

City Council of Puerto del Rosario
The island is divided into six municipalities with their respective city councils which form part of the FECAM (Federation of Canarian Municipalities). They are governed by the basic legislation of the local regime and their respective organic rules. The populations of the municipalities are as follows:

NameArea

In turn, these municipalities are organised into two associations: the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Norte de Fuerteventura formed from La Oliva and Puerto del Rosario, and the remaining municipalities make up the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Sur de Fuerteventura.[35]

Economy
Both Fuerteventura and Lanzarote would be the main exporters of wheat and cereals to the central islands of the archipelago during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries; Tenerife and Gran Canaria.[36] Although this trade almost never reversed in the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (due to the fact that the landowners of these islands profited from this activity), producing periods of famine, so the population of these islands He had to travel to Tenerife and Gran Canaria to try to improve his luck. Being the island of Tenerife as the main focus of attraction for the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, hence the feeling of union that has always existed in the popular sphere with Tenerife.[36]

The economy of Fuerteventura is mainly based on tourism. Primary tourist areas are located around the existing towns of Corralejo in the north and Morro Jable in Jandia, plus the purely tourist development of Caleta de Fuste, south of Puerto del Rosario. Other main industries are fishing and agriculture (cereals and vegetables). The famous Majorero cheese is locally made from the milk of the indigenous majorera goat.

In 2009, Fuerteventura recorded the highest EU regional unemployment rate at a NUTS3 level, at 29.2 percent.[37]

Tourism

Fuerteventura coastline
The first tourist hotel was built in 1965 followed by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral, heralding the dawn of a new era for the island. Fuerteventura, with its 3,000 sunshine hours a year, was placed firmly on the world stage as a major European holiday destination.[38] While having fully developed tourist facilities, the island has not experienced the overdevelopment found on some other islands.[citation needed] Nonetheless, it remains a destination for predominantly but not exclusively European tourists.[39]

The summer Trade Winds and winter swells of the Atlantic make this a year-round surfers' paradise, with more exposed areas on the north and west shores such as Corralejo and El Cotillo proving most popular. Wind surfing takes places at locations around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.[40]

Excellent sandy beaches are found in many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can experience strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of Corralejo are popular, as are the more protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between Costa Calma and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.[citation needed]

Much of the interior, with its large plains, lavascapes and volcanic mountains, consists of protected areas, although there are organised tours and vehicular access across them.

Like the rest of the Canaries, Carnival is traditionally one of the biggest festivals celebrated on the island. It is celebrated in different ways in all the towns during February and March. These festivities have a different theme each year. They include activities such as parades and galas to choose the carnival king.

Concerts and festivals

King África in Puerto del Rosario in 2000
There are many concerts and festivals held in the auditoriums, such as the Festival of Canarian Music. They are also held in smaller venues across the island, featuring bands such as Estopa, Van Gogh's Ear, and King Afrhica.

Lebrancho Rock: in 2004, the Town Hall of Puerto del Rosario started this initiative for the growing number of local bands who had been performing in the area for years but had not had the chance to play at the same event.
Fuertemusica: like Lebrancho Rock, this festival aims to encourage the local or emerging groups. It started in the same year. This festival is mainly for groups that are already known in the music world. It takes place in El Cotillo.
In the municipality of Betancuria (more specifically in the village of Vega de Rio Palmas) held every year the festivities in honor of the Virgen de la Peña, patron saint of the island of Fuerteventura, the most representative is the pilgrimage in which are involved people from all corners of the island. The holiday is celebrated on the third Saturday of September.
Festival Internacional de Cometas/International Kite Festival is held on the second week of November each year centering on the Corralejo Beaches. It attracts kitefliers and kite surfers from all over Europe. It is popular because the winds are warm and constant and the beaches become filled with hundreds of colourful kites of all shapes and sizes.[41]

Auditoriums

Central library
The Central Library of the Island is located in Antigua's city centre, in the public university. In addition to providing the traditional library services, it has a 180-seat multipurpose room, air conditioning, a wifi zone, and a multimedia room used for seminars, presentations, film festivals etc.

Museums and exhibition spaces

The museum in Betancuria
The island has several museums with different themes and plenty of exhibition spaces, both public and private. These include:

The Antigua Windmill Craft Centre
The Salt Museum
The Atalayita Archeological Interpretation Centre
Sculpture park
In addition to the museums, the capital Puerto del Rosario has an open-air sculpture park consisting of around 100 sculptures by different artists scattered across the city. Most of them were created for the International Symposium of Sculpture celebrated annually since 2001. During the festival, artists come from all over the world to erect their sculptures in the open air, in full view of passers by.

Main sights
Sites of interest include Corralejo and El Jable to the north which are made up of fine sand dunes whilst the south is filled with long beaches and remote bays. The constant winds blowing onto the beaches provide a paradise for windsurfing. Surfing is common on the west and north coasts where there are large waves. Windsurfing is common around Corralejo and Playas de Sotavento and wave sailing (windsurfing on the waves) on the coast along the northern half of the island. El Cotillo is a small fishing village in the north-west of the Island famous for a very long beach to the south of the village and few very calm beaches to the north. The northern beaches frequented by snorkeling enthusiasts and sun worshippers alike are referred to as lakes by the locals.


The wreck of American Star (SS America) seen in July 2004 from land side
At Cofete on the western side of Jandía a remote and imposing house – Villa Winter – looks out to sea across wide beaches. It was reputedly built by a Mr Winter on land given by Generalisimo Franco.

For a time, the beaches were home to a popular accidental attraction. On 18 January 1994 the United States Lines ocean liner SS American Star (former America, USS West Point, Australis) was beached in Playa de Garcey during a severe storm. Within a year, she broke in two and later lost her stern. By 2007 the rest of the severely deteriorated ship had collapsed onto her port side, gradually keeling over further and almost completely submerged. By 2008–2012, most of the remains finally slipped below the surface.

Food

Majorera cheese
The cuisine is fairly basic due to the customs and climate conditions. They share this simplicity with the other Canary islands, and similarly to them, they use a large quantity of fish. They also use whatever they can grow in the near-barren land. This includes papas arrugadas, a dish of wrinkled potatoes usually served with mojo, which is a hot pepper sauce or with puchero canario, a meat stew.

Seafood is prepared in many ways traditionally, such as pejines (salted fish),[42] jareas,[43] or sancocho (a type of stew) made from fish, generally the grouper,[44] corvina or sama, boiled after salting, and served with mojo, potatoes, or gofio (a type of grain). People are also very keen on the mussels and limpets collected on the island's coasts.

They also use meat such as beef and pork to make different dishes or simply to for braising, but their main meat is goat, both from the kids and from the older animals. They eat the goat roasted or stewed. Goats are not only useful for their meat – the Fuerteventurans also use the milk to make the cheese majorero, which has won many prizes. The majorero is mostly made of goats milk, and occasionally it is up to 15% ewes milk. It is cured in pimento oil or gofio meal. Majorero and palmero cheese are the only two Canarian cheeses with protected denomination of origin.

Sport
Many sports are commonly played in Fuerteventura, both in the open air and in sports centres across the island.

Native sports
These are the Canarian sports found on the island:

Canarian wrestling
The wrestling takes place in a ring of sand called the terrero. Inside it, the two contestants try to knock each other over. Fuerteventura has 14 terreros distributed through all the towns except Betancuria.

Antigua: Terrero de Antigua.
La Oliva: Terrero Venancio Guerra and Terrero de Villaverde.
Pájara: Terrero Miguel Díaz La Lajita, Terrero de Morro Jable a Terrero de Pájara.
Puerto del Rosario: Terrero de Casillas del Angel, Terrero Manuel Nieves, Terrero de Puerto Cabras, Terrero de Tefía a Terrero de Tetir.
Tuineje: Terrero de Gran Tarajal, Terrero de Tamasite, and Terrero Pedro Sánchez in Tarajalejo.
The island also has a school wrestling league organized by the council and a programme to promote this sport in clubs. Twelve wrestling schools participate in this, based in Antigua, Costa Calma, El Matorral, La Lajita, Lajares, Las Playitas, Morro Jable, Puerto del Rosario, Tefía, Tetir, Unión Sur and Villaverde.

Juego del Palo

An exhibition during FEDETUR 2000, in Pozo Negro (Antigua) on 23 September 2000
Juego del Palo is a Canarian martial art which literally translates as &quot;game of the stick&quot;. It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All we know is that it is based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.

Fuerteventura has the following Palo clubs:[45]

Club-Escuela Dunas de Corralejo.
Club-Escuela Huriamen de Villaverde.
Club-Escuela Puerto Cabras.
Club-Escuela Sorinque de Gran Tarajal.
Canarian boules
This is a similar game to the French Pétanque which is actually played very little on the island, although there are a few teams and courts. Basically the game consists of scoring points by throwing a ball to get it as near as possible to an object called a mingue or boliche. It is played on a rectangular sand or earth pitch which is 18 to 25 metres (59.1–82.0 feet) long and 3.5 to 6 metres (11.5–19.7 feet) wide.

Simple Petanque Rules -

Watersports
The sea and climate conditions make the island the perfect place for a huge variety of watersports.

Surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing

Windsurfing in Corralejo
Many types of surfing are popular on the island, including traditional surfing, windsurfing (where the board is propelled by a sail) and most recently kitesurfing. The island has many schools and courses dedicated to teaching these sports.

The sports where Fuerteventura has the most impact internationally are windsurfing and kitesurfing, mainly due to the International Windsurfing and Kiteboarding Championship. This has run since 1985 and is held at Playas de Sotavento in Pájara municipality. Many important wind and kitesurfing figures compete in this championship, such as the several-times world windsurfing champion Björn Dunkerbeck and Gisela Pulido, the very young kiteboarding champion from Tarifa.

Many Canarian windsurfers are on the Canarian Waveriders circuit, which has been based in Corralejo since 2005.

Diving
Diving schools are just as frequent as surfing ones, all around the coast of Fuerteventura. Unlike the other islands of the archipelago, Fuerteventura has a shelf which at some points goes up to 30 kilometres (19 miles), making it an ideal place to practice this sport.

Two of the most useful points for diving are the coast off Playa del Matorral in the South, and the zone between Lobos Island and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo – Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, professional dives, lessons in underwater photography, screenings and other events related to the sport.

Swimming
There are many swimming pools on the island but the most obvious place to swim is in the open sea. There is an annual swim from Lobos Island to Fuerteventura, held every year since 1999. The event attracts amateur swimmers from all over the Canaries and Spain, and also swimming professionals such as David Meca and Maarten van der Weijden, the paralympist Jesús Collado Alarcón who won gold medals for 100m backstroke and butterfly in Athens 2004, and Xavi Torres Ramis, the paralympic champion in Barcelona 1992, Sydney and Atlanta.

Sailing

The harbour at Caleta de Fuste (Antigua)
The island holds competitions involving different types of boat, such as the lateen and the Optimist. An interesting event is the Tour of Fuerteventura by Kayak, which is organised as a series of stages rather than a competition, and is an easy way to explore the island.

Fishing
The most notable competition here is the Gran Tarajal Fishing Open.

Other sports
Since 2004 the Marcha Ciclotourista has been held in La Oliva and the Criterium Ciclista has been held in Corralejo (also part of the La Oliva municipality) since 2005. Participants include Euskaltel–Euskadi, T-Mobile and a team from Orbea. These competitions have contributed to local interest in the sport and the first professional local team, the Fuerteventura-Canarias, was formed, initially run by Óscar Guerrero, director of Kaiku, although they have not competed for the past few seasons.

There are various motocross circuits on the island, including Los Alares in Antigua and Isla de Fuerteventura in Puerto del Rosario municipality. They hold regular trials, some of which form part of the Canarian Regional Motocross Championship. Throughout the year there are gravel rally races. Two are part of the Canarian Dirt Rally Championship. These are the Antiguan Rally and the La Oliva Rally.

The island's main football clubs are CD Union Puerto and CD Cotillo, who play in Group XII of the Spanish Tercera División.

The resort Playitas on the south coast is since around 2008 equipped with a 50-metre (160-foot) swimming pool and has become a destination for triathlon training camps for Europeans. An annual race called Challenge Fuerteventura is held there on the half ironman distance.

Description: Corralejo (pronounced [koraˈlexo]) is a town and resort located on the northern tip of Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands, facing the smaller islet of Lobos. It is in the municipality of La Oliva. It is surrounded to the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, by dunes to the south and by arid desert land to the west that leads to the western coast and El Cotillo. Once a traditional fishing village, the town has grown significantly and today is one of the two main tourist towns on the island of Fuerteventura. Thanks to the large expat population, the town has a diverse population that varies from the local Spaniard, to the Irish, British, German and Finnish people who have settled in the resort.

Fuerteventura is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean and is part of the North Africa region, politically part of Spain. At 1,659.74 square kilometres (640.83 sq mi), it is the second largest of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife. As at the start of 2019, Fuerteventura had 116,886 inhabitants.[2] It was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in May 2009. Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.

Etymology
The island's name is a compound word formed by the Spanish words for &quot;strong&quot; (fuerte) and &quot;fortune&quot; (ventura). Traditionally, Fuerteventura's name has been regarded as a reference to the strong winds around the island and the resulting danger to nautical adventurers. However, it might have referred instead (or also) to wealth, luck or destiny.

In 1339 the Mallorcan navigator Angelino Dulcert, in the Planisferio de Angelino Dulcert]], referred to the island as &quot;Forte Ventura&quot;.[3][4][5]

Another theory is that the island's name derives from &quot;Fortunatae Insulae&quot; (Fortunate Islands), the name by which the Romans knew the Canary Islands.[6]

The indigenous name of the island, before its conquest in the 15th century, was Erbania, divided into two regions (Jandía and Maxorata), from which the name majorero (originally majo or maxo) derives. However, it has been suggested that, at some point, Maxorata (which meant &quot;the children of the country&quot;) was the aboriginal toponym of the entire island.[7]

History

Morro Jable
Precolonial history

The two kingdoms of the Precolonial Fuerteventura, Jandía and Maxorata
The first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa. The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as Planaria, in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.

Phoenician settlers landed in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.

Several Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the islands were organized around 1340, followed by Moors and European slave traders. At the end of the Iberian conquest, the island was divided into two Guanches kingdoms, one adhering to King Guize and the other to King Ayoze. The territories of these kingdoms were called Maxorata (in the North) and Jandía (in the South) respectively. They were separated by a wall, which traversed the La Pared isthmus. Some remains have been preserved. The ancient name for the island, Erbania, is derived from this wall's name.[8]

The conquest
The island's conquest began in earnest in 1402, commanded by French knights and crusaders Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle.[9] They arrived with only 63 sailors out of the original 283, as many had deserted along the way. After arriving and settling in Lanzarote, the invaders made some first excursions to the neighboring islands. In 1404, Bethencourt and Gadifer founded Betancuria, on the West coast, the first settlement on the island. After numerous difficulties, Gadifer took charge of the invasion, while Bethencourt returned to Spain to seek the recognition and support of the Castilian king.


Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, Betancuria
In 1405, de Béthencourt completed his conquest of the island, establishing its capital in Betancuria (Puerto Rosario took over the mantle as island capital in 1835).

In 1424 Pope Martin V, through the Betancuria Brief, edicted the establishment of the Bishopric of Fuerteventura, which encompassed all the Canary Islands save for the island of Lanzarote.[10] The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the Great Schism (1378–1417), in that the bishop of San Marcial del Rubicón of Lanzarote (at the time, the only diocese in the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, and instead adhered to anti-Pope Benedict XIII. The Bishopric of Fuerteventura was based in the Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, bestowing upon the latter the status of Grant Cathedral. After the reabsorbtion of the Diocese of San Marcial del Rubicón by the papacy of Pope of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished in 1431, only seven years after it was created.[10]

The first census[when?] recorded a population of some 1,200 inhabitants. The population increased gradually thereafter. In 1476 the territory became the Señorío Territorial de Fuerteventura, subjected to the Catholic Monarchs.[11] In later years, the island was invaded by the Spanish, French and the English.

2nd conquest of Fuerteventura
Over time, the island endured numerous pirate raids. A Berber-led expedition invaded in 1593, sweeping as far inland as the capital. Various castles were built along the coastline, to protect against these type of attacks. The population was moved inland as a second protective measure. Because of the raids, a first Captain General was dispatched to Fuerteventura, accompanied by a number of Sergeant Majors, to defend the island in the name of the Crown. At that time Betancuria became the religious capital of the island.[12]

Two major pirate attacks took place in 1740, within a month of each other. Two separate bands of English privateers attempted to loot the town of Tuineje. These attacks were however successfully averted by the local population and the island's militia. This successful repelling of the invaders is celebrated at a re-enactment that takes place in Gran Tarajal every year in October.[13]

The island's garrison was officially instated in 1708. Its colonel assumed the title of Governor at Arms, a hereditary, lifelong appointment which has remained in the Sánchez-Dumpiérrez family. In time, this family increasingly garnered power over the other islands through alliances with the family of Arias de Saavedra and the Lady of Fuerteventura.[14] During the same year the Assistant Parish of La Oliva and Pájara was created, to become operational in 1711. On 17 December 1790 the Assistant Parish of Tuineje was created, which became a new parish division on 23 June 1792 under the bishop Tavira, with lands including part of the Jandía peninsular, and with a population of 1,670 inhabitants. 1780 saw the start of a barrilla plantation industry.[15]

To the present
In 1852, a free trade zone was extended by Isabella II to the Canary Islands. Military island rule, which began in 1708, was finally dissolved in 1859, and Puerto de Cabras (now Puerto del Rosario) became the new capital.


Caleta de Fuste and its castle
The Canary Islands obtained self-governance in 1912. In 1927, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote became part of the province of Gran Canaria. The seat of the island's government (cabildo insular) is located in Puerto del Rosario. A total of 118,574 people lived on the island in 2018.

By the 1940s the island had an airport (just west of Puerto del Rosario on the road to Tindaya, still visible today). Mass tourism began to arrive in the mid-1960s, facilitated by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral and the first tourist hotels.[16]

The island's proximity (a mere 100 km) to the West African coast and the fact that it is part of the Schengen territory make it a prime target destination for undocumented immigrants. However, many have perished while attempting the crossing.[17]

Flag of Fuerteventura

Flag of Fuerteventura
The flag of Fuerteventura is in proportions 1:2, divided vertically, green to the hoist and white to the fly end, with the coat of arms of the island in the centre.

Coat of Arms
The coat of arms of Fuerteventura was prescribed by a Decree adopted on 15 October 1998 by the Government of the Canary Islands and published on 11 November 1998 in the official gazette of the Canary Islands, No. 142, pp. 13,432–13,433. It was adopted on 24 April 1998 by the Island Council and validated on 18 September 1998 by the Heraldry Commission of the Canary Islands.

The heraldic description is &quot;per pale and per fess. First, gules, a castle or, masoned sable, its gate and windows azure. Second, argent, lion gules, crowned, armed and langued or. Third, silver, three fesses chequy gules and or, in four rows, each one charged with a fess or. Bordure gules, with eight saltires or. Ensigned with a royal crown, open.&quot;

According to José Manuel Erbez (Banderas y escudos de Canarias, 2007), the coat of arms is based on the arms of the island's provincial militia. The upper quarters represent Castile (symbolized by a castle) and León (symbolized by a lion). The lower quarter alludes to the Saavedra family; various members of this family were lords of Fuerteventura. [18][19]

Geography

Barranco de Pecenescal
Environment

Euphorbia regis-jubae, food plant of Hyles tithymali
The elongated island has an area of 1,660 km2 (641 sq mi). The island is 100 kilometres (62 miles) long and 31 kilometres (19 miles) wide. It is part of the province of Las Palmas. It is divided into six municipalities:

Antigua
Betancuria
La Oliva
Pájara
Puerto del Rosario
Tuineje
100 individual settlements are distributed through these municipalities. A nearby islet, Islote de Lobos, is part of the municipality of La Oliva.

Located just 100 km (62 mi) off the coast of North Africa, it is the second biggest of the islands, after Tenerife, and has the longest white sand beaches in the archipelago. The island is a destination for sun, beach and watersports enthusiasts. It lies at the same latitude as Florida and Mexico and temperatures rarely fall below 18 °C (64 °F) or rise above 32 °C (90 °F). It counts 152 separate beaches along its seaboard — 50 km (31 mi) of white sand and 25 km (16 mi) of black volcanic shingle.

The highest point in Fuerteventura is Pico de la Zarza (807 m) in the southwestern part of the island. Geographical features include Istmo de la Pared which is 5 km (3 mi) wide and is the narrowest part of Fuerteventura. The island is divided into two parts, the northern portion which is Maxorata and the southwestern part called the Jandía peninsula.

Climate
The climate on Fuerteventura is pleasant throughout the year. The island is hence referred to as the island of eternal spring. The sea regulates air temperature, diverting hot Sahara winds away from the island. The island's name in English translates as &quot;strong fortune&quot; or &quot;strong wind&quot;, the Spanish word for wind being viento. During the winter months, temperatures average a high of 22 °C (72 °F) and a low of around 15 °C (59 °F), whereas during the summer a mean high of 28 °C (82 °F) and a low of 20 °C (68 °F) can be expected. Precipitation is about 147 mm (6 in) per year, most of which falls in autumn and winter. December is the month with highest rainfall.

A sandstorm known as the Calima (similar to the Sirocco wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between 100 to 200 m (328.08 to 656.17 ft) or even lower, and together with very warm temperatures, it can even bring African locusts to the island.


Hydrology
In the winter months, up to 80% of the rainwater flows unused into the ocean, as there is no vegetation to capture the water (also due to overgrazing by free-ranging goats near the coast). The mountain forests, which were still present in the 19th century, were all chopped down. Instead, there are many desalination plants (running on electricity) which produce the required amount of freshwater on the island. The tourists on the island use about double the amount of water as the native inhabitants of Fuerteventura. Causes are the filling of swimming pools, watering hotel gardens and washing towels, ...[21]

Geology
Fuerteventura is the oldest island in the Canary Islands dating back 20 million years to a volcanic eruption from the Canary hotspot.[22] The majority of the island was created about 5 million years ago and since then has been eroded by wind and precipitation. On the seabed off the West coast of the island rests an enormous slab of bedrock 22 km (14 mi) long and 11 km (7 mi) wide, which appears to have slid off the island largely intact at some point in prehistory, similar to the predicted future collapse of Cumbre Vieja, a geological fault on another Canary Island, La Palma. The last volcanic activity in Fuerteventura occurred between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.

Beaches

The black-sand beach at Ajuy
Fuerteventura was chosen among 500 European destinations by the Quality Coast International Certification Program of the European Coastal and Marine Union as one of the most attractive tourist destinations for visitors interested in cultural heritage, environment and sustainability. The best beaches to visit are Playas de Corralejo, Playa de Ajuy, Playa de Cofete and Playas de El Cotillo.[23]

The hunting wasp Delta dimiatipenne
The island is home to one of the two surviving populations of the threatened Canarian Egyptian vulture. It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the collared dove, common swifts and several finch species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.

Despite its arid climate, the island is also home to a surprisingly large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (Colias hyale) and the bath white (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor (Anax imperator) and the scarlet darter (Crocothemis erythraea) can be found. The island's sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).

Hawkmoths also occur on the island. One of the more notable species is Hyles tithymali which feeds on endemic spurges such as Euphorbia regis-jubae. Acherontia atropos, the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the Solanaceae, for example, Datura innoxia and Nicotiana glauca which are common weeds in the vicinity of human habitation.

Natural symbols

Demographics

Population
The island has a population of 116,886.[2] Throughout its long history, Fuerteventura has suffered from a population decline due to the economic situation and the climate, which have made it into a desert island. However, the development of tourism during the 1980s has caused the population to grow year on year since then, doubling it in a little less than a decade.

In 2005, with 86,642 registered inhabitants,[25] the Fuerteventura population was formed by the following:

Born on the island: 30,364
Born on another Canary Island: 13,175
Born elsewhere in Spain: 20,938
Born in other countries: 22,165
Comparing this data with the 2001 census shows that the number of permanent residents born on the island has increased by just 3,000. The number who have moved in from abroad has increased by 22,910, making this the biggest contributor to population growth in recent years.[26]

Education
The island has 116 schools,[27] with a total of 14,337 pupils.[28] Of these, 45 are primary schools, ten are secondary schools, six are for Baccalaureate students and four are vocational colleges.[29]

Fuerteventura also has a centre linked with the National University of Distance Education, offering courses in many subjects including economics, business studies, law, history and tourism.[30]

State administration
Fuerteventura is governed by the Island Department of the Government of Spain, which holds the rank of a Government Subdepartment. The government building is located in the centre of the capital city.

This institution is charged with representing the Government of Spain on the island, and managing all the functions that are not under control of the Canarian Government. This includes the following public services:

Island Security Forces (National Police and Guardia Civil)
Puerto del Rosario port and Fuerteventura Airport
Tax Agency
Customs
the Maritime and Coastguard department
Driving licences, Traffic and Highways
Immigration – the Immigration Detention Centre and residential permits
Social Security
Red Cross
Seprona (the Nature Protection Service)
Passports
Since 30 June 2007, the island's governor has been Eustaquio Juan Santana Gil.[31] 4

Island Council of Fuerteventura (Cabildo)
The councils, formed as part of the Councils Act of 1912, administer the Canary Islands and have two principal functions. On one hand, they perform services for the Autonomous Community, and on the other, they are the local government centre for the island. In the 2003 elections, Mario Cabrera González was elected as president representing the Canarian Coalition, with 31.02% of the votes, followed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 27.53%, represented by the Vice President Domingo Fuentes Curbelo.

Municipalities

City Council of Puerto del Rosario
The island is divided into six municipalities with their respective city councils which form part of the FECAM (Federation of Canarian Municipalities). They are governed by the basic legislation of the local regime and their respective organic rules. The populations of the municipalities are as follows:

NameArea

In turn, these municipalities are organised into two associations: the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Norte de Fuerteventura formed from La Oliva and Puerto del Rosario, and the remaining municipalities make up the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Sur de Fuerteventura.[35]

Economy
Both Fuerteventura and Lanzarote would be the main exporters of wheat and cereals to the central islands of the archipelago during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries; Tenerife and Gran Canaria.[36] Although this trade almost never reversed in the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (due to the fact that the landowners of these islands profited from this activity), producing periods of famine, so the population of these islands He had to travel to Tenerife and Gran Canaria to try to improve his luck. Being the island of Tenerife as the main focus of attraction for the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, hence the feeling of union that has always existed in the popular sphere with Tenerife.[36]

The economy of Fuerteventura is mainly based on tourism. Primary tourist areas are located around the existing towns of Corralejo in the north and Morro Jable in Jandia, plus the purely tourist development of Caleta de Fuste, south of Puerto del Rosario. Other main industries are fishing and agriculture (cereals and vegetables). The famous Majorero cheese is locally made from the milk of the indigenous majorera goat.

In 2009, Fuerteventura recorded the highest EU regional unemployment rate at a NUTS3 level, at 29.2 percent.[37]

Tourism

Fuerteventura coastline
The first tourist hotel was built in 1965 followed by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral, heralding the dawn of a new era for the island. Fuerteventura, with its 3,000 sunshine hours a year, was placed firmly on the world stage as a major European holiday destination.[38] While having fully developed tourist facilities, the island has not experienced the overdevelopment found on some other islands.[citation needed] Nonetheless, it remains a destination for predominantly but not exclusively European tourists.[39]

The summer Trade Winds and winter swells of the Atlantic make this a year-round surfers' paradise, with more exposed areas on the north and west shores such as Corralejo and El Cotillo proving most popular. Wind surfing takes places at locations around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.[40]

Excellent sandy beaches are found in many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can experience strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of Corralejo are popular, as are the more protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between Costa Calma and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.[citation needed]

Much of the interior, with its large plains, lavascapes and volcanic mountains, consists of protected areas, although there are organised tours and vehicular access across them.

Like the rest of the Canaries, Carnival is traditionally one of the biggest festivals celebrated on the island. It is celebrated in different ways in all the towns during February and March. These festivities have a different theme each year. They include activities such as parades and galas to choose the carnival king.

Concerts and festivals

King África in Puerto del Rosario in 2000
There are many concerts and festivals held in the auditoriums, such as the Festival of Canarian Music. They are also held in smaller venues across the island, featuring bands such as Estopa, Van Gogh's Ear, and King Afrhica.

Lebrancho Rock: in 2004, the Town Hall of Puerto del Rosario started this initiative for the growing number of local bands who had been performing in the area for years but had not had the chance to play at the same event.
Fuertemusica: like Lebrancho Rock, this festival aims to encourage the local or emerging groups. It started in the same year. This festival is mainly for groups that are already known in the music world. It takes place in El Cotillo.
In the municipality of Betancuria (more specifically in the village of Vega de Rio Palmas) held every year the festivities in honor of the Virgen de la Peña, patron saint of the island of Fuerteventura, the most representative is the pilgrimage in which are involved people from all corners of the island. The holiday is celebrated on the third Saturday of September.
Festival Internacional de Cometas/International Kite Festival is held on the second week of November each year centering on the Corralejo Beaches. It attracts kitefliers and kite surfers from all over Europe. It is popular because the winds are warm and constant and the beaches become filled with hundreds of colourful kites of all shapes and sizes.[41]

Auditoriums

Fuerteventura has three auditoriums. These are used for all types of performing art. They are also used for non-artistic purposes, such as conferences, charity galas and political meetings.

The Isle of Fuerteventura Auditorium
Gran Tarajal Auditorium
Corralejo Auditorium
Central library
The Central Library of the Island is located in Antigua's city centre, in the public university. In addition to providing the traditional library services, it has a 180-seat multipurpose room, air conditioning, a wifi zone, and a multimedia room used for seminars, presentations, film festivals etc.

Museums and exhibition spaces

The museum in Betancuria
The island has several museums with different themes and plenty of exhibition spaces, both public and private. These include:

The Antigua Windmill Craft Centre
The Salt Museum
The Atalayita Archeological Interpretation Centre
Sculpture park
In addition to the museums, the capital Puerto del Rosario has an open-air sculpture park consisting of around 100 sculptures by different artists scattered across the city. Most of them were created for the International Symposium of Sculpture celebrated annually since 2001. During the festival, artists come from all over the world to erect their sculptures in the open air, in full view of passers by.

Main sights
Sites of interest include Corralejo and El Jable to the north which are made up of fine sand dunes whilst the south is filled with long beaches and remote bays. The constant winds blowing onto the beaches provide a paradise for windsurfing. Surfing is common on the west and north coasts where there are large waves. Windsurfing is common around Corralejo and Playas de Sotavento and wave sailing (windsurfing on the waves) on the coast along the northern half of the island. El Cotillo is a small fishing village in the north-west of the Island famous for a very long beach to the south of the village and few very calm beaches to the north. The northern beaches frequented by snorkeling enthusiasts and sun worshippers alike are referred to as lakes by the locals.


The wreck of American Star (SS America) seen in July 2004 from land side
At Cofete on the western side of Jandía a remote and imposing house – Villa Winter – looks out to sea across wide beaches. It was reputedly built by a Mr Winter on land given by Generalisimo Franco.

For a time, the beaches were home to a popular accidental attraction. On 18 January 1994 the United States Lines ocean liner SS American Star (former America, USS West Point, Australis) was beached in Playa de Garcey during a severe storm. Within a year, she broke in two and later lost her stern. By 2007 the rest of the severely deteriorated ship had collapsed onto her port side, gradually keeling over further and almost completely submerged. By 2008–2012, most of the remains finally slipped below the surface.

Food

Majorera cheese
The cuisine is fairly basic due to the customs and climate conditions. They share this simplicity with the other Canary islands, and similarly to them, they use a large quantity of fish. They also use whatever they can grow in the near-barren land. This includes papas arrugadas, a dish of wrinkled potatoes usually served with mojo, which is a hot pepper sauce or with puchero canario, a meat stew.

Seafood is prepared in many ways traditionally, such as pejines (salted fish),[42] jareas,[43] or sancocho (a type of stew) made from fish, generally the grouper,[44] corvina or sama, boiled after salting, and served with mojo, potatoes, or gofio (a type of grain). People are also very keen on the mussels and limpets collected on the island's coasts.

They also use meat such as beef and pork to make different dishes or simply to for braising, but their main meat is goat, both from the kids and from the older animals. They eat the goat roasted or stewed. Goats are not only useful for their meat – the Fuerteventurans also use the milk to make the cheese majorero, which has won many prizes. The majorero is mostly made of goats milk, and occasionally it is up to 15% ewes milk. It is cured in pimento oil or gofio meal. Majorero and palmero cheese are the only two Canarian cheeses with protected denomination of origin.

Sport
Many sports are commonly played in Fuerteventura, both in the open air and in sports centres across the island.

Native sports
These are the Canarian sports found on the island:

Canarian wrestling
The wrestling takes place in a ring of sand called the terrero. Inside it, the two contestants try to knock each other over. Fuerteventura has 14 terreros distributed through all the towns except Betancuria.

Antigua: Terrero de Antigua.
La Oliva: Terrero Venancio Guerra and Terrero de Villaverde.
Pájara: Terrero Miguel Díaz La Lajita, Terrero de Morro Jable a Terrero de Pájara.
Puerto del Rosario: Terrero de Casillas del Angel, Terrero Manuel Nieves, Terrero de Puerto Cabras, Terrero de Tefía a Terrero de Tetir.
Tuineje: Terrero de Gran Tarajal, Terrero de Tamasite, and Terrero Pedro Sánchez in Tarajalejo.
The island also has a school wrestling league organized by the council and a programme to promote this sport in clubs. Twelve wrestling schools participate in this, based in Antigua, Costa Calma, El Matorral, La Lajita, Lajares, Las Playitas, Morro Jable, Puerto del Rosario, Tefía, Tetir, Unión Sur and Villaverde.

Juego del Palo

An exhibition during FEDETUR 2000, in Pozo Negro (Antigua) on 23 September 2000
Juego del Palo is a Canarian martial art which literally translates as &quot;game of the stick&quot;. It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All we know is that it is based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.

Fuerteventura has the following Palo clubs:[45]

Club-Escuela Dunas de Corralejo.
Club-Escuela Huriamen de Villaverde.
Club-Escuela Puerto Cabras.
Club-Escuela Sorinque de Gran Tarajal.
Canarian boules
This is a similar game to the French Pétanque which is actually played very little on the island, although there are a few teams and courts. Basically the game consists of scoring points by throwing a ball to get it as near as possible to an object called a mingue or boliche. It is played on a rectangular sand or earth pitch which is 18 to 25 metres (59.1–82.0 feet) long and 3.5 to 6 metres (11.5–19.7 feet) wide.

Watersports
The sea and climate conditions make the island the perfect place for a huge variety of watersports.

Surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing

Windsurfing in Corralejo
Many types of surfing are popular on the island, including traditional surfing, windsurfing (where the board is propelled by a sail) and most recently kitesurfing. The island has many schools and courses dedicated to teaching these sports.

The sports where Fuerteventura has the most impact internationally are windsurfing and kitesurfing, mainly due to the International Windsurfing and Kiteboarding Championship. This has run since 1985 and is held at Playas de Sotavento in Pájara municipality. Many important wind and kitesurfing figures compete in this championship, such as the several-times world windsurfing champion Björn Dunkerbeck and Gisela Pulido, the very young kiteboarding champion from Tarifa.

Many Canarian windsurfers are on the Canarian Waveriders circuit, which has been based in Corralejo since 2005.

Diving
Diving schools are just as frequent as surfing ones, all around the coast of Fuerteventura. Unlike the other islands of the archipelago, Fuerteventura has a shelf which at some points goes up to 30 kilometres (19 miles), making it an ideal place to practice this sport.

Two of the most useful points for diving are the coast off Playa del Matorral in the South, and the zone between Lobos Island and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo – Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, professional dives, lessons in underwater photography, screenings and other events related to the sport.

Swimming
There are many swimming pools on the island but the most obvious place to swim is in the open sea. There is an annual swim from Lobos Island to Fuerteventura, held every year since 1999. The event attracts amateur swimmers from all over the Canaries and Spain, and also swimming professionals such as David Meca and Maarten van der Weijden, the paralympist Jesús Collado Alarcón who won gold medals for 100m backstroke and butterfly in Athens 2004, and Xavi Torres Ramis, the paralympic champion in Barcelona 1992, Sydney and Atlanta.

Sailing

The harbour at Caleta de Fuste (Antigua)
The island holds competitions involving different types of boat, such as the lateen and the Optimist. An interesting event is the Tour of Fuerteventura by Kayak, which is organised as a series of stages rather than a competition, and is an easy way to explore the island.

Fishing
The most notable competition here is the Gran Tarajal Fishing Open.

Other sports
Since 2004 the Marcha Ciclotourista has been held in La Oliva and the Criterium Ciclista has been held in Corralejo (also part of the La Oliva municipality) since 2005. Participants include Euskaltel–Euskadi, T-Mobile and a team from Orbea. These competitions have contributed to local interest in the sport and the first professional local team, the Fuerteventura-Canarias, was formed, initially run by Óscar Guerrero, director of Kaiku, although they have not competed for the past few seasons.

There are various motocross circuits on the island, including Los Alares in Antigua and Isla de Fuerteventura in Puerto del Rosario municipality. They hold regular trials, some of which form part of the Canarian Regional Motocross Championship. Throughout the year there are gravel rally races. Two are part of the Canarian Dirt Rally Championship. These are the Antiguan Rally and the La Oliva Rally.

The island's main football clubs are CD Union Puerto and CD Cotillo, who play in Group XII of the Spanish Tercera División.

The resort Playitas on the south coast is since around 2008 equipped with a 50-metre (160-foot) swimming pool and has become a destination for triathlon training camps for Europeans. An annual race called Challenge Fuerteventura is held there on the half ironman distance.

Description: Corralejo (pronounced [koraˈlexo]) is a town and resort located on the northern tip of Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands, facing the smaller islet of Lobos. It is in the municipality of La Oliva. It is surrounded to the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, by dunes to the south and by arid desert land to the west that leads to the western coast and El Cotillo. Once a traditional fishing village, the town has grown significantly and today is one of the two main tourist towns on the island of Fuerteventura. Thanks to the large expat population, the town has a diverse population that varies from the local Spaniard, to the Irish, British, German and Finnish people who have settled in the resort.

Fuerteventura is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean and is part of the North Africa region, politically part of Spain. At 1,659.74 square kilometres (640.83 sq mi), it is the second largest of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife. As at the start of 2019, Fuerteventura had 116,886 inhabitants.[2] It was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in May 2009. Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.

Etymology
The island's name is a compound word formed by the Spanish words for &quot;strong&quot; (fuerte) and &quot;fortune&quot; (ventura). Traditionally, Fuerteventura's name has been regarded as a reference to the strong winds around the island and the resulting danger to nautical adventurers. However, it might have referred instead (or also) to wealth, luck or destiny.

In 1339 the Mallorcan navigator Angelino Dulcert, in the Planisferio de Angelino Dulcert]], referred to the island as &quot;Forte Ventura&quot;.[3][4][5]

Another theory is that the island's name derives from &quot;Fortunatae Insulae&quot; (Fortunate Islands), the name by which the Romans knew the Canary Islands.[6]

The indigenous name of the island, before its conquest in the 15th century, was Erbania, divided into two regions (Jandía and Maxorata), from which the name majorero (originally majo or maxo) derives. However, it has been suggested that, at some point, Maxorata (which meant &quot;the children of the country&quot;) was the aboriginal toponym of the entire island.[7]

History

Morro Jable
Precolonial history

The two kingdoms of the Precolonial Fuerteventura, Jandía and Maxorata
The first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa. The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as Planaria, in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.

Phoenician settlers landed in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.

Several Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the islands were organized around 1340, followed by Moors and European slave traders. At the end of the Iberian conquest, the island was divided into two Guanches kingdoms, one adhering to King Guize and the other to King Ayoze. The territories of these kingdoms were called Maxorata (in the North) and Jandía (in the South) respectively. They were separated by a wall, which traversed the La Pared isthmus. Some remains have been preserved. The ancient name for the island, Erbania, is derived from this wall's name.[8]

The conquest
The island's conquest began in earnest in 1402, commanded by French knights and crusaders Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle.[9] They arrived with only 63 sailors out of the original 283, as many had deserted along the way. After arriving and settling in Lanzarote, the invaders made some first excursions to the neighboring islands. In 1404, Bethencourt and Gadifer founded Betancuria, on the West coast, the first settlement on the island. After numerous difficulties, Gadifer took charge of the invasion, while Bethencourt returned to Spain to seek the recognition and support of the Castilian king.


Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, Betancuria
In 1405, de Béthencourt completed his conquest of the island, establishing its capital in Betancuria (Puerto Rosario took over the mantle as island capital in 1835).

In 1424 Pope Martin V, through the Betancuria Brief, edicted the establishment of the Bishopric of Fuerteventura, which encompassed all the Canary Islands save for the island of Lanzarote.[10] The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the Great Schism (1378–1417), in that the bishop of San Marcial del Rubicón of Lanzarote (at the time, the only diocese in the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, and instead adhered to anti-Pope Benedict XIII. The Bishopric of Fuerteventura was based in the Parish of Santa María de Betancuria, bestowing upon the latter the status of Grant Cathedral. After the reabsorbtion of the Diocese of San Marcial del Rubicón by the papacy of Pope of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished in 1431, only seven years after it was created.[10]

The first census[when?] recorded a population of some 1,200 inhabitants. The population increased gradually thereafter. In 1476 the territory became the Señorío Territorial de Fuerteventura, subjected to the Catholic Monarchs.[11] In later years, the island was invaded by the Spanish, French and the English.

2nd conquest of Fuerteventura
Over time, the island endured numerous pirate raids. A Berber-led expedition invaded in 1593, sweeping as far inland as the capital. Various castles were built along the coastline, to protect against these type of attacks. The population was moved inland as a second protective measure. Because of the raids, a first Captain General was dispatched to Fuerteventura, accompanied by a number of Sergeant Majors, to defend the island in the name of the Crown. At that time Betancuria became the religious capital of the island.[12]

Two major pirate attacks took place in 1740, within a month of each other. Two separate bands of English privateers attempted to loot the town of Tuineje. These attacks were however successfully averted by the local population and the island's militia. This successful repelling of the invaders is celebrated at a re-enactment that takes place in Gran Tarajal every year in October.[13]

The island's garrison was officially instated in 1708. Its colonel assumed the title of Governor at Arms, a hereditary, lifelong appointment which has remained in the Sánchez-Dumpiérrez family. In time, this family increasingly garnered power over the other islands through alliances with the family of Arias de Saavedra and the Lady of Fuerteventura.[14] During the same year the Assistant Parish of La Oliva and Pájara was created, to become operational in 1711. On 17 December 1790 the Assistant Parish of Tuineje was created, which became a new parish division on 23 June 1792 under the bishop Tavira, with lands including part of the Jandía peninsular, and with a population of 1,670 inhabitants. 1780 saw the start of a barrilla plantation industry.[15]

To the present
In 1852, a free trade zone was extended by Isabella II to the Canary Islands. Military island rule, which began in 1708, was finally dissolved in 1859, and Puerto de Cabras (now Puerto del Rosario) became the new capital.


Caleta de Fuste and its castle
The Canary Islands obtained self-governance in 1912. In 1927, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote became part of the province of Gran Canaria. The seat of the island's government (cabildo insular) is located in Puerto del Rosario. A total of 118,574 people lived on the island in 2018.

By the 1940s the island had an airport (just west of Puerto del Rosario on the road to Tindaya, still visible today). Mass tourism began to arrive in the mid-1960s, facilitated by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral and the first tourist hotels.[16]

The island's proximity (a mere 100 km) to the West African coast and the fact that it is part of the Schengen territory make it a prime target destination for undocumented immigrants. However, many have perished while attempting the crossing.[17]

Flag of Fuerteventura

Flag of Fuerteventura
The flag of Fuerteventura is in proportions 1:2, divided vertically, green to the hoist and white to the fly end, with the coat of arms of the island in the centre.

Coat of Arms
The coat of arms of Fuerteventura was prescribed by a Decree adopted on 15 October 1998 by the Government of the Canary Islands and published on 11 November 1998 in the official gazette of the Canary Islands, No. 142, pp. 13,432–13,433. It was adopted on 24 April 1998 by the Island Council and validated on 18 September 1998 by the Heraldry Commission of the Canary Islands.

The heraldic description is &quot;per pale and per fess. First, gules, a castle or, masoned sable, its gate and windows azure. Second, argent, lion gules, crowned, armed and langued or. Third, silver, three fesses chequy gules and or, in four rows, each one charged with a fess or. Bordure gules, with eight saltires or. Ensigned with a royal crown, open.&quot;

According to José Manuel Erbez (Banderas y escudos de Canarias, 2007), the coat of arms is based on the arms of the island's provincial militia. The upper quarters represent Castile (symbolized by a castle) and León (symbolized by a lion). The lower quarter alludes to the Saavedra family; various members of this family were lords of Fuerteventura. [18][19]

Geography

Barranco de Pecenescal
Environment

Euphorbia regis-jubae, food plant of Hyles tithymali
The elongated island has an area of 1,660 km2 (641 sq mi). The island is 100 kilometres (62 miles) long and 31 kilometres (19 miles) wide. It is part of the province of Las Palmas. It is divided into six municipalities:

Antigua
Betancuria
La Oliva
Pájara
Puerto del Rosario
Tuineje
100 individual settlements are distributed through these municipalities. A nearby islet, Islote de Lobos, is part of the municipality of La Oliva.

Located just 100 km (62 mi) off the coast of North Africa, it is the second biggest of the islands, after Tenerife, and has the longest white sand beaches in the archipelago. The island is a destination for sun, beach and watersports enthusiasts. It lies at the same latitude as Florida and Mexico and temperatures rarely fall below 18 °C (64 °F) or rise above 32 °C (90 °F). It counts 152 separate beaches along its seaboard — 50 km (31 mi) of white sand and 25 km (16 mi) of black volcanic shingle.

The highest point in Fuerteventura is Pico de la Zarza (807 m) in the southwestern part of the island. Geographical features include Istmo de la Pared which is 5 km (3 mi) wide and is the narrowest part of Fuerteventura. The island is divided into two parts, the northern portion which is Maxorata and the southwestern part called the Jandía peninsula.

Climate
The climate on Fuerteventura is pleasant throughout the year. The island is hence referred to as the island of eternal spring. The sea regulates air temperature, diverting hot Sahara winds away from the island. The island's name in English translates as &quot;strong fortune&quot; or &quot;strong wind&quot;, the Spanish word for wind being viento. During the winter months, temperatures average a high of 22 °C (72 °F) and a low of around 15 °C (59 °F), whereas during the summer a mean high of 28 °C (82 °F) and a low of 20 °C (68 °F) can be expected. Precipitation is about 147 mm (6 in) per year, most of which falls in autumn and winter. December is the month with highest rainfall.

A sandstorm known as the Calima (similar to the Sirocco wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between 100 to 200 m (328.08 to 656.17 ft) or even lower, and together with very warm temperatures, it can even bring African locusts to the island.


Hydrology
In the winter months, up to 80% of the rainwater flows unused into the ocean, as there is no vegetation to capture the water (also due to overgrazing by free-ranging goats near the coast). The mountain forests, which were still present in the 19th century, were all chopped down. Instead, there are many desalination plants (running on electricity) which produce the required amount of freshwater on the island. The tourists on the island use about double the amount of water as the native inhabitants of Fuerteventura. Causes are the filling of swimming pools, watering hotel gardens and washing towels, ...[21]

Geology
Fuerteventura is the oldest island in the Canary Islands dating back 20 million years to a volcanic eruption from the Canary hotspot.[22] The majority of the island was created about 5 million years ago and since then has been eroded by wind and precipitation. On the seabed off the West coast of the island rests an enormous slab of bedrock 22 km (14 mi) long and 11 km (7 mi) wide, which appears to have slid off the island largely intact at some point in prehistory, similar to the predicted future collapse of Cumbre Vieja, a geological fault on another Canary Island, La Palma. The last volcanic activity in Fuerteventura occurred between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.

Beaches

The black-sand beach at Ajuy
Fuerteventura was chosen among 500 European destinations by the Quality Coast International Certification Program of the European Coastal and Marine Union as one of the most attractive tourist destinations for visitors interested in cultural heritage, environment and sustainability. The best beaches to visit are Playas de Corralejo, Playa de Ajuy, Playa de Cofete and Playas de El Cotillo.[23]

The hunting wasp Delta dimiatipenne
The island is home to one of the two surviving populations of the threatened Canarian Egyptian vulture. It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the collared dove, common swifts and several finch species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.

Despite its arid climate, the island is also home to a surprisingly large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (Colias hyale) and the bath white (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor (Anax imperator) and the scarlet darter (Crocothemis erythraea) can be found. The island's sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).

Hawkmoths also occur on the island. One of the more notable species is Hyles tithymali which feeds on endemic spurges such as Euphorbia regis-jubae. Acherontia atropos, the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the Solanaceae, for example, Datura innoxia and Nicotiana glauca which are common weeds in the vicinity of human habitation.

Population
The island has a population of 116,886.[2] Throughout its long history, Fuerteventura has suffered from a population decline due to the economic situation and the climate, which have made it into a desert island. However, the development of tourism during the 1980s has caused the population to grow year on year since then, doubling it in a little less than a decade.

In 2005, with 86,642 registered inhabitants,[25] the Fuerteventura population was formed by the following:

Born on the island: 30,364
Born on another Canary Island: 13,175
Born elsewhere in Spain: 20,938
Born in other countries: 22,165
Comparing this data with the 2001 census shows that the number of permanent residents born on the island has increased by just 3,000. The number who have moved in from abroad has increased by 22,910, making this the biggest contributor to population growth in recent years.[26]

Education
The island has 116 schools,[27] with a total of 14,337 pupils.[28] Of these, 45 are primary schools, ten are secondary schools, six are for Baccalaureate students and four are vocational colleges.[29]

Fuerteventura also has a centre linked with the National University of Distance Education, offering courses in many subjects including economics, business studies, law, history and tourism.[30]

State administration
Fuerteventura is governed by the Island Department of the Government of Spain, which holds the rank of a Government Subdepartment. The government building is located in the centre of the capital city.

This institution is charged with representing the Government of Spain on the island, and managing all the functions that are not under control of the Canarian Government. This includes the following public services:

Island Security Forces (National Police and Guardia Civil)
Puerto del Rosario port and Fuerteventura Airport
Tax Agency
Customs
the Maritime and Coastguard department
Driving licences, Traffic and Highways
Immigration – the Immigration Detention Centre and residential permits
Social Security
Red Cross
Seprona (the Nature Protection Service)
Passports
Since 30 June 2007, the island's governor has been Eustaquio Juan Santana Gil.[31] 4

Island Council of Fuerteventura (Cabildo)
The councils, formed as part of the Councils Act of 1912, administer the Canary Islands and have two principal functions. On one hand, they perform services for the Autonomous Community, and on the other, they are the local government centre for the island. In the 2003 elections, Mario Cabrera González was elected as president representing the Canarian Coalition, with 31.02% of the votes, followed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 27.53%, represented by the Vice President Domingo Fuentes Curbelo.

Municipalities

City Council of Puerto del Rosario
The island is divided into six municipalities with their respective city councils which form part of the FECAM (Federation of Canarian Municipalities). They are governed by the basic legislation of the local regime and their respective organic rules. The populations of the municipalities are as follows:

NameArea
(km2)Population

In turn, these municipalities are organised into two associations: the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Norte de Fuerteventura formed from La Oliva and Puerto del Rosario, and the remaining municipalities make up the Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Sur de Fuerteventura.[35]

Economy
Both Fuerteventura and Lanzarote would be the main exporters of wheat and cereals to the central islands of the archipelago during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries; Tenerife and Gran Canaria.[36] Although this trade almost never reversed in the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (due to the fact that the landowners of these islands profited from this activity), producing periods of famine, so the population of these islands He had to travel to Tenerife and Gran Canaria to try to improve his luck. Being the island of Tenerife as the main focus of attraction for the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, hence the feeling of union that has always existed in the popular sphere with Tenerife.[36]

The economy of Fuerteventura is mainly based on tourism. Primary tourist areas are located around the existing towns of Corralejo in the north and Morro Jable in Jandia, plus the purely tourist development of Caleta de Fuste, south of Puerto del Rosario. Other main industries are fishing and agriculture (cereals and vegetables). The famous Majorero cheese is locally made from the milk of the indigenous majorera goat.

In 2009, Fuerteventura recorded the highest EU regional unemployment rate at a NUTS3 level, at 29.2 percent.[37]

Tourism

Fuerteventura coastline
The first tourist hotel was built in 1965 followed by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral, heralding the dawn of a new era for the island. Fuerteventura, with its 3,000 sunshine hours a year, was placed firmly on the world stage as a major European holiday destination.[38] While having fully developed tourist facilities, the island has not experienced the overdevelopment found on some other islands.[citation needed] Nonetheless, it remains a destination for predominantly but not exclusively European tourists.[39]

The summer Trade Winds and winter swells of the Atlantic make this a year-round surfers' paradise, with more exposed areas on the north and west shores such as Corralejo and El Cotillo proving most popular. Wind surfing takes places at locations around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.[40]

Excellent sandy beaches are found in many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can experience strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of Corralejo are popular, as are the more protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between Costa Calma and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.[citation needed]

Much of the interior, with its large plains, lavascapes and volcanic mountains, consists of protected areas, although there are organised tours and vehicular access across them.

Like the rest of the Canaries, Carnival is traditionally one of the biggest festivals celebrated on the island. It is celebrated in different ways in all the towns during February and March. These festivities have a different theme each year. They include activities such as parades and galas to choose the carnival king.

Concerts and festivals

King África in Puerto del Rosario in 2000
There are many concerts and festivals held in the auditoriums, such as the Festival of Canarian Music. They are also held in smaller venues across the island, featuring bands such as Estopa, Van Gogh's Ear, and King Afrhica.

Lebrancho Rock: in 2004, the Town Hall of Puerto del Rosario started this initiative for the growing number of local bands who had been performing in the area for years but had not had the chance to play at the same event.
Fuertemusica: like Lebrancho Rock, this festival aims to encourage the local or emerging groups. It started in the same year. This festival is mainly for groups that are already known in the music world. It takes place in El Cotillo.
In the municipality of Betancuria (more specifically in the village of Vega de Rio Palmas) held every year the festivities in honor of the Virgen de la Peña, patron saint of the island of Fuerteventura, the most representative is the pilgrimage in which are involved people from all corners of the island. The holiday is celebrated on the third Saturday of September.
Festival Internacional de Cometas/International Kite Festival is held on the second week of November each year centering on the Corralejo Beaches. It attracts kitefliers and kite surfers from all over Europe. It is popular because the winds are warm and constant and the beaches become filled with hundreds of colourful kites of all shapes and sizes.[41]

Auditoriums

Fuerteventura has three auditoriums. These are used for all types of performing art. They are also used for non-artistic purposes, such as conferences, charity galas and political meetings.

The Isle of Fuerteventura Auditorium
Gran Tarajal Auditorium
Corralejo Auditorium
Central library
The Central Library of the Island is located in Antigua's city centre, in the public university. In addition to providing the traditional library services, it has a 180-seat multipurpose room, air conditioning, a wifi zone, and a multimedia room used for seminars, presentations, film festivals etc.

Museums and exhibition spaces

The museum in Betancuria
The island has several museums with different themes and plenty of exhibition spaces, both public and private. These include:

The Antigua Windmill Craft Centre
The Salt Museum
The Atalayita Archeological Interpretation Centre
Sculpture park
In addition to the museums, the capital Puerto del Rosario has an open-air sculpture park consisting of around 100 sculptures by different artists scattered across the city. Most of them were created for the International Symposium of Sculpture celebrated annually since 2001. During the festival, artists come from all over the world to erect their sculptures in the open air, in full view of passers by.

Main sights
Sites of interest include Corralejo and El Jable to the north which are made up of fine sand dunes whilst the south is filled with long beaches and remote bays. The constant winds blowing onto the beaches provide a paradise for windsurfing. Surfing is common on the west and north coasts where there are large waves. Windsurfing is common around Corralejo and Playas de Sotavento and wave sailing (windsurfing on the waves) on the coast along the northern half of the island. El Cotillo is a small fishing village in the north-west of the Island famous for a very long beach to the south of the village and few very calm beaches to the north. The northern beaches frequented by snorkeling enthusiasts and sun worshippers alike are referred to as lakes by the locals.


The wreck of American Star (SS America) seen in July 2004 from land side
At Cofete on the western side of Jandía a remote and imposing house – Villa Winter – looks out to sea across wide beaches. It was reputedly built by a Mr Winter on land given by Generalisimo Franco.

For a time, the beaches were home to a popular accidental attraction. On 18 January 1994 the United States Lines ocean liner SS American Star (former America, USS West Point, Australis) was beached in Playa de Garcey during a severe storm. Within a year, she broke in two and later lost her stern. By 2007 the rest of the severely deteriorated ship had collapsed onto her port side, gradually keeling over further and almost completely submerged. By 2008–2012, most of the remains finally slipped below the surface.

Food

Majorera cheese
The cuisine is fairly basic due to the customs and climate conditions. They share this simplicity with the other Canary islands, and similarly to them, they use a large quantity of fish. They also use whatever they can grow in the near-barren land. This includes papas arrugadas, a dish of wrinkled potatoes usually served with mojo, which is a hot pepper sauce or with puchero canario, a meat stew.

Seafood is prepared in many ways traditionally, such as pejines (salted fish),[42] jareas,[43] or sancocho (a type of stew) made from fish, generally the grouper,[44] corvina or sama, boiled after salting, and served with mojo, potatoes, or gofio (a type of grain). People are also very keen on the mussels and limpets collected on the island's coasts.

They also use meat such as beef and pork to make different dishes or simply to for braising, but their main meat is goat, both from the kids and from the older animals. They eat the goat roasted or stewed. Goats are not only useful for their meat – the Fuerteventurans also use the milk to make the cheese majorero, which has won many prizes. The majorero is mostly made of goats milk, and occasionally it is up to 15% ewes milk. It is cured in pimento oil or gofio meal. Majorero and palmero cheese are the only two Canarian cheeses with protected denomination of origin.

Sport
Many sports are commonly played in Fuerteventura, both in the open air and in sports centres across the island.

Native sports
These are the Canarian sports found on the island:

Canarian wrestling
The wrestling takes place in a ring of sand called the terrero. Inside it, the two contestants try to knock each other over. Fuerteventura has 14 terreros distributed through all the towns except Betancuria.

Antigua: Terrero de Antigua.
La Oliva: Terrero Venancio Guerra and Terrero de Villaverde.
Pájara: Terrero Miguel Díaz La Lajita, Terrero de Morro Jable a Terrero de Pájara.
Puerto del Rosario: Terrero de Casillas del Angel, Terrero Manuel Nieves, Terrero de Puerto Cabras, Terrero de Tefía a Terrero de Tetir.
Tuineje: Terrero de Gran Tarajal, Terrero de Tamasite, and Terrero Pedro Sánchez in Tarajalejo.
The island also has a school wrestling league organized by the council and a programme to promote this sport in clubs. Twelve wrestling schools participate in this, based in Antigua, Costa Calma, El Matorral, La Lajita, Lajares, Las Playitas, Morro Jable, Puerto del Rosario, Tefía, Tetir, Unión Sur and Villaverde.

Juego del Palo

An exhibition during FEDETUR 2000, in Pozo Negro (Antigua) on 23 September 2000
Juego del Palo is a Canarian martial art which literally translates as &quot;game of the stick&quot;. It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All we know is that it is based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.

Fuerteventura has the following Palo clubs:[45]

Club-Escuela Dunas de Corralejo.
Club-Escuela Huriamen de Villaverde.
Club-Escuela Puerto Cabras.
Club-Escuela Sorinque de Gran Tarajal.
Canarian boules
This is a similar game to the French Pétanque which is actually played very little on the island, although there are a few teams and courts. Basically the game consists of scoring points by throwing a ball to get it as near as possible to an object called a mingue or boliche. It is played on a rectangular sand or earth pitch which is 18 to 25 metres (59.1–82.0 feet) long and 3.5 to 6 metres (11.5–19.7 feet) wide.

Simple Petanque Rules -

Watersports
The sea and climate conditions make the island the perfect place for a huge variety of watersports.

Surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing

Windsurfing in Corralejo
Many types of surfing are popular on the island, including traditional surfing, windsurfing (where the board is propelled by a sail) and most recently kitesurfing. The island has many schools and courses dedicated to teaching these sports.

The sports where Fuerteventura has the most impact internationally are windsurfing and kitesurfing, mainly due to the International Windsurfing and Kiteboarding Championship. This has run since 1985 and is held at Playas de Sotavento in Pájara municipality. Many important wind and kitesurfing figures compete in this championship, such as the several-times world windsurfing champion Björn Dunkerbeck and Gisela Pulido, the very young kiteboarding champion from Tarifa.

Many Canarian windsurfers are on the Canarian Waveriders circuit, which has been based in Corralejo since 2005.

Diving
Diving schools are just as frequent as surfing ones, all around the coast of Fuerteventura. Unlike the other islands of the archipelago, Fuerteventura has a shelf which at some points goes up to 30 kilometres (19 miles), making it an ideal place to practice this sport.

Two of the most useful points for diving are the coast off Playa del Matorral in the South, and the zone between Lobos Island and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo – Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, professional dives, lessons in underwater photography, screenings and other events related to the sport.

Swimming
There are many swimming pools on the island but the most obvious place to swim is in the open sea. There is an annual swim from Lobos Island to Fuerteventura, held every year since 1999. The event attracts amateur swimmers from all over the Canaries and Spain, and also swimming professionals such as David Meca and Maarten van der Weijden, the paralympist Jesús Collado Alarcón who won gold medals for 100m backstroke and butterfly in Athens 2004, and Xavi Torres Ramis, the paralympic champion in Barcelona 1992, Sydney and Atlanta.

Sailing

The harbour at Caleta de Fuste (Antigua)
The island holds competitions involving different types of boat, such as the lateen and the Optimist. An interesting event is the Tour of Fuerteventura by Kayak, which is organised as a series of stages rather than a competition, and is an easy way to explore the island.

Fishing
The most notable competition here is the Gran Tarajal Fishing Open.

Other sports
Since 2004 the Marcha Ciclotourista has been held in La Oliva and the Criterium Ciclista has been held in Corralejo (also part of the La Oliva municipality) since 2005. Participants include Euskaltel–Euskadi, T-Mobile and a team from Orbea. These competitions have contributed to local interest in the sport and the first professional local team, the Fuerteventura-Canarias, was formed, initially run by Óscar Guerrero, director of Kaiku, although they have not competed for the past few seasons.

There are various motocross circuits on the island, including Los Alares in Antigua and Isla de Fuerteventura in Puerto del Rosario municipality. They hold regular trials, some of which form part of the Canarian Regional Motocross Championship. Throughout the year there are gravel rally races. Two are part of the Canarian Dirt Rally Championship. These are the Antiguan Rally and the La Oliva Rally.

The island's main football clubs are CD Union Puerto and CD Cotillo, who play in Group XII of the Spanish Tercera División.

The resort Playitas on the south coast is since around 2008 equipped with a 50-metre (160-foot) swimming pool and has become a destination for triathlon training camps for Europeans. An annual race called Challenge Fuerteventura is held there on the half ironman distance.

This Wasp Beetle was snuck down on a partially rotted tree branch, don't let the Bokeh confuse you, the antennae were right in front of its eyes, and I remember thinking how does this little guy see anything, but of course, insect sight is many times poorer than that of a human, so thus they of course predominantly, feel their way around. Still, the insect world is an interesting. 

I hope everyone is well and so as always, thank you! :)

Description: Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171 km southeast of Darwin.
The park is located within the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. It covers an area of 19,804 km2 (7,646 sq mi), extending nearly 200 kilometres from north to south and over 100 kilometres from east to west. It is the size of Slovenia, about one-third the size of Tasmania, or nearly half the size of Switzerland. 
The park comprises several landforms – sandstone escarpment and plateaux, savannah woodlands, monsoon forests, tidal and freshwater rivers, wetlands and tidal deltas.
The name Kakadu may come from the mispronunciation of Gaagudju, which is the name of an Aboriginal language spoken in the northern part of the park. This name may derive from the Indonesian word kakatuwah, (via Dutch kaketoe and German Kakadu) subsequently Anglicised as &quot;cockatoo”. 
Aboriginal people have occupied the Kakadu area continuously for at least 40,000 years. Kakadu National Park is renowned for the richness of its Aboriginal cultural sites. There are more than 5,000 recorded art sites illustrating Aboriginal culture over thousands of years. The archaeological sites demonstrate Aboriginal occupation for up to 60,000 years.
The cultural and natural values of Kakadu National Park were recognised internationally when the park was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This is an international register of properties that are recognised as having outstanding cultural or natural values of international significance. Kakadu was listed in three stages: stage 1 in 1981, stage 2 in 1987, and the entire park in 1992. 
Approximately half of the land in Kakadu is Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and most of the remaining land is currently under claim by Aboriginal people. The areas of the park that are owned by Aboriginal people are leased by the traditional owners to the Director of National Parks to be managed as a national park. The remaining area is Commonwealth land vested under the Director of National Parks. All of Kakadu is declared a national park under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. 
The Aboriginal traditional owners of the park are descendants of various clan groups from the Kakadu area and have longstanding affiliations with this country. Their lifestyle has changed in recent years, but their traditional customs and beliefs remain very important. About 500 Aboriginal people live in the park, many of them are traditional owners. All of Kakadu is jointly managed by Aboriginal traditional owners and the Australian Government's Department of the Environment and Water Resources through a division known as Parks Australia. Park Management is directed by the Kakadu Board of Management.

Nourlangie Rock (Burrunggui), Nawurlandja &amp; Nanguluwurr– Kakadu National Park
Burrunggui (sometimes spelled Burrunguy, previously called Nourlangie Rock) is located in an outlying sandstone formation of the Arnhem Land Escarpment within the Kakadu National Park which is in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is the traditional Country of the Gun-djeihmi speaking people and according to Traditional Owners, was shaped by Ancestral beings in the creation period of the Dreaming. It was included on the World Heritage Register. Kakadu National Park is included on UNESCO the World Heritage List due to its exceptional natural and cultural values.
Europeans were first in the area of Nourlangie Rock in about 1845, after Ludwig Leichhardt’s explorations passed through the area. By the 1880s, European buffalo and buffalo shooters had moved into the area, and local Traditional Owners joined their shooting parties. Traditional owners told the buffalo shooters about the Dreaming stories at Burrungui and the many names of all the natural features of the landscapes. Chaloupka argues that the Europeans couldn’t remember all of the names, and called the area ‘Nourlangie’, a confused pronunciation of the name of the area generally called ‘Nawulandja’.
There are a number of shelters in amongst this large outcrop. The shelters contain amazing paintings that represent the Aboriginal Dreaming, with depictions of Namandi spirits, both male and female figures and one with six fingers on each hand. Many paintings in the Burrungui area also depict European items and introduced animals. Pigments are mostly of yellow, white and red ochre, with red ochre being used as a chalk to draw on the rock surface in some places. Early art at the site is evidenced in handprints on the rock in red pigment, or gars being flung on the rock. The paintings at Burrungui are in the Mimi and x-ray style, with Mimi being older and representative of Dreaming Ancestral beings. There are even depictions of Thylacines (Tasmanian Tigers), known to have been extinct in the area for at least 3,500 years. Superimpositioning of many animals such as kangaroos layered over one another, assist in the establishment of a temporal sequence at the site, however there appears to still be much research and work needed at the site for this to occur. 
The rock art faces many threats to its survival, including tourists and destruction from natural processes such as ant trail that go across the older panels at Burrungui, water damage and wasp nesting. Interpretive signage is present at the art sites to assist visitors in understanding these rock art treasures and the importance of their preservation. 
The Anbangbang Shelter drawings are some of the most famous in the National Park. One of the intricate paintings in Anbangbang shelter was created by Najombolmi, a renowned artist of the Bardmardi clan, who painted the images with his friends in the 1963-64 wet season. Najombolmi lived between 1895 and 1967 and is thought to have created around 604 paintings at 46 sites in Arnhem Land. Najomboli was also known as ‘Barramundi Charlie’ by some. 
X-ray paintings are naturalistic depictions of animals that show the internal organs and other anatomical features, which were mostly painted by Aboriginal people in red and white ochre. One such painting created by Najombolmi depicts anthropomorphic figures of Ancestral beings such as Namarrgon (lightning man), painted in the x-ray style using European blue, that Chaloupka said came from the blue pigment put in washing by Europeans as a toner to keep clothes white. Paintings and rock art such as this among the only rock art that provides absolute dating of when it was produced, as rock art is notoriously difficult to date. 
Anbangbang was excavated by archaeologists in 1981 and was found to have first been occupied more than 6000 years ago, with some occasional use being up to 20,000 years ago and with intensification of site use occurring between 800 and 1200 years ago when the nearby lagoon was fully formed
Najombolmi also painted at Nangawulurr Shelter (formerly spelled Nangaloar). It is located on the northern side of Burrungui (Nourlangie Rock). Nangawulurr shelter features many styles of Aboriginal rock art that appear in other sites around the region in one area. It includes hand prints, Mimi figures in ceremonial dress, Ancestral beings, x-ray animals and dolphin-like creatures depicted in red ochre. It also features a white depiction of a two-masted sailing ship with an anchor and dingy, which may relate to the early European buffalo shooters in the area). Unfortunately due to the fame of the site for its amazing rock art, in the early 1970s tourists came and destroyed some features and even stole Aboriginal Ancestral Remains from the site.
Anbangbang Billabong
Anbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock within Kakadu National Park and is a good place to view a wide range of wildlife. Large numbers of water fowl and wading birds inhabit the billabong and many wallabies can be found grazing around the water’s edge. There is a walking trail around the circumference of Anbangbang billabong with many picnic areas. The Anbangbang Billabong is overlooked by the Nawurlandja and Nourlangie plateaus. In the wet season, it is fed by runoff from these plateaus, as well as overflow from Nourlangie Creek, however during the dry season it is cut off. 
Like much of Kakadu, Anbangbang Billabong is home to a particularly large variety of bird life. The fluctuating water levels draw waterfowl such as Magpie Geese, Pelicans, Darters, Spoonbills and Brolga. Other fauna known to frequent the billabong include Wallabies, File Snakes, Long-necked Turtles, Dingoes and Goannas. 
Mangroves lining the billabong support populations of Freshwater mussel. Adjacent woodlands play host to a different ecosystem again. The nearby Nawurlandja plateau supports local populations of Short-eared rock-wallaby and Chestnut-quilled rock pigeon, among other species. 
The swelling billabong promotes seasonal growth of Sedges, Grasses and Water Lilies, and Freshwater mangrove line the water's edge. Swamp areas support many types of paperbark, in particular the Weeping paperbark, Silver-leaved paperbark and Broad-leaved paperbark. 
The woodlands surrounding the billabong are a lush habitat comprising an abundance of plant species. Darwin woollybutt and Darwin Stringybark dominate, with large populations of Fan palms, Kapok, Red Apples, Wattle and Pandanus. 
Like much of Kakadu, the Anbangbang Billabong region's climate is monsoonal. The region's aboriginal owners recognize six seasons, however these can be reduced to vastly differing dry and wet seasons where the billabong is respectively depleted and replenished.

The reference to Friday the 12th. August, coupled with the unfranked 9 pence stamp on the back of the card mean that the card was written in 1977.

<u>High Wycombe</u>

High Wycombe, often referred to simply as Wycombe, is a large market town in Buckinghamshire. Lying in the valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills, it is 29 miles (47 km) west north-west of Charing Cross in London; this information is also engraved on the Corn Market building in the centre of the town. 

In 2016, High Wycombe had a population of 125,260, and is the second largest town in the county of Buckinghamshire after Milton Keynes.

Wycombe is a combination of industrial and market town, with a traditional emphasis on furniture production. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the Middle Ages. The market is held on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

<u>History of High Wycombe</u>

Wycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th.-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.

High Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and Tudor times, manufacturing lace and linen cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.

The paper industry was notable in 17th. and 18th. century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. However the paper industry was overtaken by the cloth industry.

Wycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly Windsor chairs), took hold in the 19th. century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. 

In 1875, there were 4,700 chairs being made per day in High Wycombe. When Queen Victoria visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words 'Long Live the Queen' printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. 

Wycombe Museum includes many examples of locally made chairs along with information on the local furniture and lace industries.

The town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960's.

<u>High Wycombe in the 20th. Century</u>

By the 1920's, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A slum clearance scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents re-housed in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes. 

Some of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation, with sewage pouring down the street and people sharing one room in cramped quarters of subdivided flats. However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th. and 19th. century architecture.

From 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of RAF Bomber Command. Moreover, during the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force's 8th. Air Force Bomber Command, code-named 'Pinetree', was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe. 

In the 1960's the town centre was redeveloped. This involved culverting the River Wye under concrete and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe's town centre. Two shopping centres were built along with many new multi-storey car parks, office blocks, flyovers and roundabouts. On the open area known as Frogmoor (or Frogmore) the original cast-iron fountain and some Georgian buildings were also torn down. (...Sounds as if they ruined the town centre).

Although situated in the county of Buckinghamshire, which is one of the more affluent parts of the country, Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas. In 2007, a GMB Union survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th. dirtiest in the South East, and the 26th. dirtiest in the whole of the UK. The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways.

<u>High Wycombe Politics</u>

Wycombe's political history extends back to 1295. 

The Wycombe Constituency has continuously elected Conservative Members of Parliament since 1951.

High Wycombe has been home to two Prime Ministers:

- The Earl of Shelburne lived at what is now Wycombe Abbey. 

- Benjamin Disraeli, who lived at nearby Hughenden Manor, was defeated as an independent candidate in 1832, but won the election in 1868 and 1874-1880 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel on the High Street (now Iceland/Bargain buys). 

Although the hotel has gone, the portico with the red lion on top has survived - you can just about see it on the right, beyond the yellow car.

<u>Weighing the Mayor</u>

A ceremony carried out in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. 

The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th. century. When the result is known, the town crier announces &quot;And No More!&quot; if the mayor has not gained weight, or &quot;And Some More!&quot; if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.

<u>Media Coverage of High Wycombe</u>

High Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including:

- Coverage of the local library's refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster.

- The triple shooting of three young Asian men.

- A small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used whilst a gunman sprayed bullets.

- The shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at point-blank range in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.

- The town appeared in national and international media after anti-terrorism raids were carried out as part of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town's Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.

- On the 21st. December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks. Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight.

Description: The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist.[2][3][4] They are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.

The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for 2018 was 40 million tonnes, with 45% of the world total grown in China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.

Etymology

The word is first recorded in English circa 1530 and was borrowed from Middle French carotte,[5] itself from Late Latin carōta, from Greek καρωτόν or karōtón, originally from the Indo-European root *ker- (horn), due to its horn-like shape. In Old English, carrots (typically white at the time) were not clearly distinguished from parsnips: the two were collectively called moru or more (from Proto-Indo-European *mork- &quot;edible root&quot;, cf. German Möhre or Russian морковь/morkov).

Various languages still use the same word for &quot;carrot&quot; as they do for &quot;root&quot;; e.g. Dutch wortel.[6]

History

Both written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia.[2][3] Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.[7][8]

 
A depiction labeled &quot;garden&quot; carrot from the Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan copy of Dioscorides' 1st-century Greek pharmacopoeia. The facing page states that &quot;the root can be cooked and eaten.&quot;[9]
When they were first cultivated, carrots were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds have been found in Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC.[10] Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century AD;[11] the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca,[12] which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.[13][14]

The plant is depicted and described in the Eastern Roman Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan copy of the Greek physician Dioscorides' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of herbs and medicines, De Materia Medica. Three different types of carrots are depicted, and the text states that &quot;the root can be cooked and eaten&quot;.[15]

 
Carrots in a range of colours
The plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century.[16] In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple.[17] The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time.[11] The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both red and yellow carrots,[18] as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam.[19] Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 14th century, and in Japan in the 18th century.[11]

There are many claims that Dutch growers created orange carrots in the 17th century to honor the Dutch flag at the time and William of Orange.[17][20] Other authorities argue these claims lack convincing evidence.[21] Modern carrots were described at about this time by the English antiquary John Aubrey (1626–1697): &quot;Carrots were first sown at Beckington in Somersetshire. Some very old Man there [in 1668] did remember their first bringing hither.&quot;[22] European settlers introduced the carrot to colonial America in the 17th century.[23]

Outwardly purple carrots, still orange on the inside, were sold in British stores beginning in 2002.[17]

Description

Daucus carota is a biennial plant. In the first year, its rosette of leaves produces large amounts of sugars, which are stored in the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.

 
Seedlings shortly after germination
Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between taproot and stem: the stem is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination. Subsequent leaves are alternate (with a single leaf attached to a node), spirally arranged, and pinnately compound, with leaf bases sheathing the stem. As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves, near the taproot, are pushed apart. The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates for flowering, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, and the stem extends upward to become a highly branched inflorescence up to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.[24]

Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem). High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core. Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity. Taproots are typically long and conical, although cylindrical and nearly-spherical cultivars are available. The root diameter can range from 1 cm (3⁄8 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part. The root length ranges from 5 to 50 cm (2 to 20 in), although most are between 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in).[24]

 
Daucus carota umbel (inflorescence). Individual flowers are borne on undivided pedicels originating from a common node.
 
Top view of Daucus carota inflorescence, showing umbellets; the central flower is dark red.
Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels.[24]

A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.[24]

 
Flowers consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx.
Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive. The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels.[24]

The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.[24]

The fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.[24]

The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18).[2][3] The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome.[25]

Chemistry

 
β-Carotene structure. Carotene is responsible for the orange colour of carrots and many other fruits and vegetables.
Polyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they show cytotoxic activities.[26][27] Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol)[28] are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides.[28] Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.[29]

Other compounds such as pyrrolidine (present in the leaves),[30] 6-hydroxymellein,[31] 6-methoxymellein, eugenin, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (gazarin) or (Z)-3-acetoxy-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-8-ol (falcarindiol 3-acetate) can also be found in carrot.

Cultivation

 
Workers harvesting carrots, Imperial Valley, California, 1948
Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions.[32] They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade.[33] The optimum temperature is 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70 °F).[34] The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.[35]

Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash. Rich or rocky soils should be avoided, as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or misshapen.[36] Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist. After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.[32][37]

Cultivation problems
See also: List of carrot diseases
There are several diseases that can reduce the yield and market value of carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which has been known to eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls.[38] Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.[39]

Physical damage can also reduce the value of carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a longitudinal crack develops during growth that can be a few centimetres to the entire length of the root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.[40]

Companion planting
Carrots benefit from strongly scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly,[35] and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, as well as the herbs rosemary and sage.[41] Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy.[35] They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.[42]

Cultivars

 
Carrot seeds
 
Seeds of Daucus carota subsp. maximus - MHNT
Carrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, eastern carrots and western carrots.[43] A number of novelty cultivars have been bred for particular characteristics.[2][3]

&quot;Eastern&quot; (a European and American continent reference) carrots were domesticated in Persia (probably in the lands of modern-day Iran and Afghanistan within West Asia) during the 10th century, or possibly earlier. Specimens of the &quot;eastern&quot; carrot that survive to the present day are commonly purple or yellow, and often have branched roots. The purple colour common in these carrots comes from anthocyanin pigments.[44]

The western carrot emerged in the Netherlands in the 17th century.[45] There is a popular belief that its orange colour making it popular in those countries as an emblem of the House of Orange and the struggle for Dutch independence, although there is little evidence for this.[21][20] The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars.

Western carrot cultivars are commonly classified by their root shape. The four general types are:

Chantenay carrots. Although the roots are shorter than other cultivars, they have vigorous foliage and greater girth, being broad in the shoulders and tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing.[37] Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.
Danvers carrots. These have strong foliage and the roots are longer than Chantenay types, and they have a conical shape with a well-defined shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing.[37] They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts.[46] Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.
Imperator carrots. This cultivar has vigorous foliage, is of high sugar content, and has long and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip. Imperator types are the most widely cultivated by commercial growers.[37] Cultivars include 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'.
Nantes carrots. These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short with a more blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a range of conditions. The skin is easily damaged and the core is deeply pigmented. They are brittle, high in sugar and store less well than other types.[37] Cultivars include 'Nelson Hybrid', 'Scarlet Nantes' and 'Sweetness Hybrid'.
Carrot breeding programs have developed new cultivars to have dense amounts of chemically-stable acylated pigments, such as anthocyanins, which enrich carrot color based on the density and types of anthocyanin to produce different carrot colors.[2][3] One particular cultivar lacks the usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots do not provide nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.[47]

In 2018, world production of carrots (combined with turnips) was 40 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (table).[48] Other major producers were the United States, Uzbekistan, and Russia.[48]

Storage

Carrots can be stored for several months in the refrigerator or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can be placed in a bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 0 to 4 °C (32 to 40 °F) is best.[49][50]

Consumption

Carrots can be eaten in a variety of ways. Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is released during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil.[51] Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods. A well-known dish is carrots julienne.[52] Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.[53]

The greens are edible as a leaf vegetable,[54][55] but are rarely eaten by humans;[56] some sources suggest that the greens contain toxic alkaloids.[57][58] When used for this purpose, they are harvested young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads.[56] Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots.[59] Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.[60]

In India carrots are used in a variety of ways, as salads or as vegetables added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added.[61] Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.[62]

Since the late 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots that have been peeled and cut into uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food available in many supermarkets.[63] Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.[64]

The sweetness of carrots allows the vegetable to be used in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century.[65] Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.[66]

Highly excessive consumption over a period of time can result in carotenemia, a yellow-orange discoloration of the skin caused by a build up of carotenoids.[67]

†Percentages are roughly approximated using US recommendations for adults.
Raw carrots are 88% water, 9% carbohydrates, 0.9% protein, 2.8% dietary fiber, 1% ash and 0.2% fat.[68] Carrot dietary fiber comprises mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch.[64] Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose, and fructose.[68]

The carrot gets its characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.[69] α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A,[70][71] providing more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots are also a good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (table).[68]

Night vision
The provitamin A beta-carotene from carrots does not actually help people to see in the dark unless they suffer from vitamin A deficiency.[72] This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels.[73] Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food.[74] The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000-ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.[75]",2021-04-05 16:30:34

Description: Niagara Falls is a city in Ontario, Canada. It is on the western bank of the Niagara River in the Golden Horseshoe region of Southern Ontario, with a population of 88,071 at the 2016 census.[1] Incorporated on 12 June 1903, the city is across the river from Niagara Falls, New York. The Niagara River flows over Niagara Falls at this location, creating a natural spectacle which attracts millions of tourists each year.

The tourist area, which stretches along the Niagara Parkway and promenade, is particularly concentrated at the brink of the falls. Apart from the river's natural attractions, it includes observation towers, high-rise hotels, souvenir shops, museums, indoor water parks, casinos and theatres, mostly with colourful neon billboards and advertisements. Farther to the north or south, golf courses are operated alongside historic sites from the War of 1812.

History
This area was long part of the Iroquois Confederacy territory: five powerful First Nations mostly along the southern edge of the Great Lakes. The Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca were based largely in present-day New York, ranging from east near the Hudson River, to western areas of Seneca Lake and along Ontario and other Great Lakes.[citation needed]

The Niagara Falls area has had some European settlement since the 17th century. Louis Hennepin, a French priest and missionary, is regarded as the first European to visit the area in the 1670s. French colonists settled mostly in Lower Canada, beginning near the Atlantic, and in Quebec and Montreal. After surveys were completed in 1782 the area was referred to as Township Number 2 as well as Mount Dorchester after Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester (and today is only honoured by Dorchester Road and the community of Dorchester Village).[5]

The earliest settlers of Township Number 2 were Philip George Bender (namesake of Bender Street and Bender Hill near Casino Niagara originally from Germany and later New Jersey and Philadelphia[5]) and Thomas McMicken (a Scottish-born British Army veteran).[5]

Increased settlement in this area took place during and after the American Revolutionary War, when the British Crown made land grants to Loyalists to help them resettle in Upper Canada and provide some compensation for their losses after the United States became independent. Loyalist Robert Land received 200 acres (81 ha) and was one of the first people of European descent to settle in the Niagara Region. He moved to nearby Hamilton three years later due to the relentless noise of the falls.[6]

In 1791, John Graves Simcoe renamed the town was Stamford after Stamford, Lincolnshire in England[5] but today Stamford is only used for an area northwest of downtown Niagara Falls as well as Stamford Street. During the war of 1812, the battle of Lundy's Lane took place in July 1814, near the town.[citation needed]

In 1856, the Town of Clifton was incorporated. The name of the town was changed to Niagara Falls in 1881. In 1882, the community of Drummondville (near the present-day corner of Lundy's Lane and Main Street) was incorporated as the village of Niagara Falls.[citation needed]

The village was referred to as Niagara Falls South to differentiate it from the town. In 1904, the town and village amalgamated to form the City of Niagara Falls. In 1962, the city amalgamated with the surrounding Stamford Township, resulting in a doubling of population. With the creation of a Niagara regional government in 1970, the city absorbed the village of Chippawa, Willoughby Township and part of Crowland Township, creating the present-day municipal boundaries.[citation needed]

Tourism started in the early 19th century and has been a vital part of the local economy since that time. The falls became known as a natural wonder, in part to their being featured in paintings by prominent American artists of the 19th century such as Albert Bierstadt. Such works were reproduced as lithographs, becoming widely distributed. In addition, Niagara Falls markets itself as a honeymoon destination; it is the self-proclaimed &quot;honeymoon capital of the world&quot;.[citation needed]

An internment camp was set up at The Armoury in Niagara Falls from December 1914 to August 1918.[7]

The city's official historian is Sherman Zavitz, who gives regular radio broadcasts on many aspects of Niagara's history.[8]

Black history

R. Nathaniel Dett Chapel, British Methodist Episcopal Church
Niagara Falls has had a Black population since at least 1783. Up to 12 African-Americans were a part of the Butler's Rangers, including Richard Pierpoint. When they were disbanded in 1783, they tried to establish themselves through farming nearby, making them among the first Black settlers in the region.[9][10] It is estimated that nearly 10 percent of the Loyalists to settle in the area were Black Loyalists.[11]

Niagara Fall's Black population increased in the following decades, as a destination on the Underground Railroad. In 1856, a British Methodist Episcopal (BME) Church was established for African-Canadian worshipers.[12] The BME Church, Nathaniel Dett Memorial Chapel is now a National Historic Site, remaining in operation into the 21st century.[13][14] Composer, organist, pianist and music professor Nathaniel Dett was born in Niagara Falls in 1882.[15]

In 1886, Burr Plato became one of the first African Canadians to be elected to political office, holding the position of City Councillor of Niagara Falls until 1901.[16][17]

Geography

Looking north on the Niagara River towards Niagara Falls, Ontario
Niagara Falls is approximately 130 km (81 mi) by road from Ontario's capital of Toronto, which is across Lake Ontario to the north. The area of the Niagara Region is approximately 1,800 km2 (690 sq mi).

Topography
The city is built along the Niagara Falls waterfalls and the Niagara Gorge on the Niagara River, which flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.

Climate
The city of Niagara Falls has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa/Dfb) which is moderated to an extent in all seasons by proximity to water bodies. Winters are cold, with a January high of −0.4 °C (31.3 °F) and a low of −7.8 °C (18.0 °F).[18] However, temperatures above 0 °C (32.0 °F) are common during winter.[18] The average annual snowfall is 154 centimetres (61 in), in which it can receive lake effect snow from both lakes Erie and Ontario. Summers are warm to hot, with a July high of 27.4 °C (81.3 °F) and a low of 17 °C (62.6 °F).[18] The average annual precipitation is 970.2 millimetres (38 in), which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.

Some 7,715 (9.5%) inhabitants described themselves as visible minorities (non-white/non-European), with the majority of those Black, Chinese, Filipino and South Asian people.[22][23]

83.97% of Niagara Falls city residents self-identified with Christian denominations. The largest denominations are Catholic (41.99%), Protestant (36.80%), and 5.18% other Christian mostly Eastern Orthodox, 14.10% claimed no religious affiliation, while other religions (1.93%) including Sikh, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim accounted for the rest.[24]

With a plentiful and inexpensive source of hydroelectric power from the waterfalls, many electro-chemical and electro-metallurgical industries located there in the early to mid-20th century.

Industry began moving out of the city in the 1970s and 80s because of economic recession and increasing global competition in the manufacturing sector. Tourism increasingly became the city's most important revenue source. Generally speaking, Niagara Falls, Ontario is a more popular destination than Niagara Falls, New York, in part due to the better view of the falls from the Canadian side of the river. In the 20th century, there was a favourable exchange rate when comparing Canadian and U.S. currencies, and Ontario had a greater focus on tourism. Also, Ontario's legal drinking age of 19, in comparison to a legal drinking age of 21 in the U.S., attracts potential alcohol consumers from across the border.

The Ontario government introduced legal gambling to the local economy in the mid-1990s. Casino Niagara precipitated an economic boom in the late 1990s as numerous luxury hotels and tourist attractions were built, and a second casino, Niagara Fallsview, opened in 2004. Both attracted American tourists due in part to the comparatively less expensive Canadian dollar, and despite the opening of the Seneca Niagara Casino on the American side. When the Canadian and US currencies moved closer to parity in the 2000s, Niagara Falls, Ontario continued to be a popular destination for Americans. Its tourist areas had many attractions and a vibrancy, while Niagara Falls, New York languished in a prolonged economic downturn.

In 2004, several tourist establishments in Niagara Falls began adding a three percent marketing fee to bills. The collected money is untraceable, and there are no controls over how each establishment spends it. The Ontario government—concerned tourists could be misled into believing the fees were endorsed by the government—warned hotels and restaurants in 2008 not to claim the fee if it was not being remitted to a legitimate non-profit agency that promotes tourism. The practise continues, and takes in an estimated $15 million per-year from tourists unaware the fee is voluntary and can be removed from their bill.[25][26]


Clifton Hill Attractions, February 2017
Recent development has been mostly centred on the Clifton Hill and Fallsview areas. The Niagara Falls downtown (Queen Street) is undergoing a major revitalization; the city is encouraging redevelopment of this area as an arts and culture district. The downtown was a major centre for local commerce and night life up until the 1970s, when the Niagara Square Shopping Centre began to draw away crowds and retailers. Since 2006, Historic Niagara has brought art galleries, boutiques, cafés and bistros to the street. Attractions include renovation of the Seneca Theatre.

On 3 October 2012, the Mayor of Niagara Falls opened the new Queen Street Downtown Park featuring a children's playground complete with soft artificial turf, benches, seating, landscaping and the &quot;Water Molecule&quot; sculpture, created by artist Derek Costello.

The city encourages location filming of movies and TV series and many have taken advantage of locations. Recent titles include several currently filming as well as Reliving Marilyn (2017 TV Movie), Fight! (2017), Odd Squad: The Movie (2016)and Blanket Fort: Vada Gets Toxic (2016).[27]

Culture
Some cultural areas of Niagara Falls include Queen Street, Main and Ferry Streets, Stamford Centre and Chippawa Square.[28][29] Community centres that are host to cultural activities include the City of Niagara Falls Museums, Niagara Falls Public Libraries, Coronation 50 Plus Recreation Centre, Club Italia and Scotia Bank Convention Centre.

Government
Niagara Falls City Council consists of eight councillors and a mayor. City elections take place every four years with the most recent election held on 27 October 2014.[31] Council is responsible for policy and decision making, monitoring the operation and performance of the city, analysing and approving budgets and determining spending priorities. Due to regulations put forward by the Municipal Elections Act 1996, elections are held on the fourth Monday in October except for religious holidays or if a member of council or if the mayor resigns.

Niagara Falls Fire Department
The city's fire and emergency service are provided from 6 stations with a staff of 133 firefighters and 78 volunteers.[32]

Three stations are full time and three are volunteer.

Policing
Provincial roads (namely the Queen Elizabeth Way) are patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the rest by Niagara Regional Police (NRPS) for city streets and general policing or Niagara Parks Police (NPP) on property relating to Niagara Parks Commission. Policing on the Canadian side of bridges (Whirlpool and Rainbow Bridges) are conducted by both Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations, but may involve Niagara Regional Police and/or OPP, as well as US agencies.[33] Michigan Central Railway Bridge is an inactive railway bridge and closed off to prevent trespassing by the Canadian Pacific Railways and can be accessed by NRPS or CBSA/CBP if required.

Description: The Airco DH.9 (from de Havilland 9) - also known after 1920 as the de Havilland DH.9 - was a British bomber used in the First World War. A single-engined biplane, it was a development of Airco's earlier, highly successful DH.4 and was ordered in very large numbers for Britain's Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force.

Its engine was unreliable, and failed to provide the expected power, giving the DH.9 poorer performance than the aircraft it was meant to replace, and resulting in heavy losses, particularly over the Western Front. The subsequently-developed DH.9A had a more powerful and reliable American Liberty L-12 engine.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
The DH.9 was designed by de Havilland for the Aircraft Manufacturing Company in 1916 as a successor to the DH.4. It used the wings and tail unit of the DH.4 but had a new fuselage. This enabled the pilot to sit closer to the gunner/observer and away from the engine and fuel tank. The other major change from the DH.4 was the choice of the promising new BHP/Galloway Adriatic engine, which was predicted to produce 300 hp (224 kW) and so give the new aircraft an adequate performance to match enemy fighters.

By this time, as a result of attacks by German bombers on London, the decision was made to almost double the size of the Royal Flying Corps, with most of the new squadrons planned to be equipped with bombers. Based on the performance estimates for the DH.9 (which were expected to surpass those of the DH.4), and the similarity to the DH.4, which meant that it would be easy to convert production over to the new aircraft, massive orders (4,630 aircraft) were placed.

The prototype (a converted DH.4) first flew at Hendon in July 1917. Unfortunately, the BHP engine proved unable to reliably deliver its expected power, with the engine being de-rated to 230 hp (186 kW) in order to improve reliability. This had a drastic effect on the aircraft's performance, especially at high altitude, with it being inferior to that of the DH.4 it was supposed to replace. This meant that the DH.9 would have to fight its way through enemy fighters, which could easily catch the DH.9 where the DH.4 could avoid many of these attacks.

While attempts were made to provide the DH.9 with an adequate engine, with aircraft being fitted with the Siddeley Puma, a lightened and supposedly more powerful version of the BHP, with the Fiat A12 engine and with a 430 hp (321 kW) Napier Lion engine, these were generally unsuccessful (although the Lion engined aircraft did set a World Altitude Record of 13,900 m on 2 January 1919) and it required redesign into the DH.9A to transform the aircraft.
Operational history

To boost the rate of production, quantity orders for the DH.9 were also placed with Alliance, G &amp; J.Weir, Short Brothers, Vulcan, Waring &amp; Gillow and National Aircraft Factories No. 1 and No. 2.

The first deliveries were made in November 1917 to 108 Squadron RFC and it first went into combat over France in March 1918 with 6 Squadron, and by July 1918 nine squadrons operational over the Western Front were using the type.

The DH.9's performance in action over the Western Front was a disaster, with heavy losses incurred, both due to its poor performance and to engine failures, despite the prior de-rating of its engine. Between May and November 1918, two squadrons on the Western Front (Nos. 99 and 104) lost 54 shot down, and another 94 written off in accidents. Nevertheless, on 23 August 1918 a DH9 flown by Lieutenant Arthur Rowe Spurling of 49 Squadron, with his observer, Sergeant Frank Bell, single-handedly attacked thirty Fokker D.VII fighters, downing five of them. Captain John Stevenson Stubbs managed 11 aerial victories in a DH9, including the highly unusual feat of balloon busting with one.

The DH.9 was also more successful against the Turkish forces in the Middle East, where they faced less opposition, and it was used extensively for coastal patrols, to try to deter the operations of U-boats.

Following the end of the First World War, DH.9s operated by 47 Squadron and 221 Squadron were sent to southern Russia in 1919 in support of the White Russian Army of General Denikin during the Russian Civil War. The last combat use by the RAF was in support of the final campaign against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (known by the British as the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;) in Somalia during January-February 1920. Surprisingly, production was allowed to continue after the end of the war into 1919, with the DH.9 finally going out of service with the RAF in 1920.

Following the end of the First World War, large number of surplus DH.9s became available at low prices and the type was widely exported (including aircraft donated to Commonwealth nations as part of the Imperial Gift programme.

The South African Air Force received 48 DH.9s, and used them extensively, using them against the Rand Revolt in 1922. Several South African aircraft were re-engined with Bristol Jupiter radial engines as the M'pala, serving until 1937.

CIVILIAN USE
Because of the large number of surplus DH.9s available after the war many were used by air transport companies. They provided a useful load carrying capability and were cheap. Early air services between London, Paris and Amsterdam were operated by DH.9s owned by Aircraft Transport and Travel. A number of different conversions for civil use were carried out, both by Airco and its successor the de Havilland Aircraft Company and by other companies, such as the Aircraft Disposal Company. Some radial powered DH.9Js continued in use until 1936.

VARIANTS
- DH.9 - Revised version of the DH.4 with the pilot and observer/gunner placed closer together (3,024 production aircraft built with others built in Belgium and Spain).
- DH.9A - (also referred to as the Nine-Ack) was designed for Airco by Westland Aircraft to take advantage of the 400 hp (298 kW) American Liberty L-12 engine. Apart from the new engine and slightly larger wings it was identical to the DH.9. Initially it was hoped to quickly replace the DH.9 with the new version, but the shortage of Liberty engines available to the RAF limited the new type's service in the First World War, and it is best known as a standard type in the postwar RAF, serving as a general purpose aircraft for several years. 2,300 DH.9As were built by ten different British companies.
- DH.9B - Conversions for civilian use as three-seaters (one pilot and two passengers)
- DH.9C - Conversions for civilian use as four-seaters (one pilot and three passengers)
- DH.9J - Modernised and re-engined conversions using the 385 hp (287 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar III radial engine. Used by the De Havilland School of Flying.
- DH.9J M'pala I - Re-engined conversions carried out by the South African Air Force. Powered by a 450 hp (336 kW)
Bristol Jupiter VI radial piston engine.
- M'pala II - Re-engined conversions carried out by the South African Air Force, powered by a 480 hp (358 kW) Bristol Jupiter VIII radial piston engine.
- Mantis - Re-engined conversions carried out by the South African Air Force, powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Wolseley Viper piston engine.
- Handley Page HP.17 - A DH.9 experimentally fitted with slotted wings
- USD-9/9A - DH.9s manufactured in the United States by the US Army's Engineering Division and Dayton-Wright. (1,415 ordered, only 4 built)

Description: German Wasp, Vespula germanica.

The German Wasp is marked with bold black and yellow bands. The black bands have arrow-shaped black markings down the centre of the abdomen, and there are pairs of small black spots on the yellow bands. The wings are long and transparent, the antennae are black and the legs are mostly yellow. 

Workers measure 12-15 mm in length; queens are similar but larger (up to about 20 mm)

It is a social wasp with a typically annual life cycle. Queens produced during late summer and autumn mate with one or more males, storing the sperm within a sperm-storage organ, the spermatheca. They then pass the winter months in hibernation in well-insulated places such as leaf litter, crevices in tree bark and also buildings and outhouses. In spring, the queens emerge from hibernation, feed at nectar sources and begin searching for suitable nesting sites. Typically such sites are hidden away: underground, behind retaining walls and rockeries in gardens, and also in cavity walls or roof spaces in buildings. The abandoned burrows of rodents and rabbits are also utilized. Only very rarely does V. germanica construct an exposed nest. 
There is sometimes competition for nest sites and spring queens may die during fights while invading or defending a nest site 
The founding queen builds her ‘embryo’ nest after collecting wood from old, seasoned dead trees, wooden poles and fences by scraping off the fibres, mixing with saliva and working with its serrated mandibles to produce thin strips of wet ‘paper’ that resemble paper-mâché or carton. The embryo nest consists of a comb of about 30 hexagonal cells with their openings facing downwards attached to the substrate with a stout pillar of wasp carton and surrounded by several round layers of umbrella-like envelopes for insulation, the whole structure being about the size and shape of a large golf ball.

Once adult worker wasps are reared to maturity, they assume all foraging and nest-building duties and the queen remains within the nest. Worker activities include excavating the nest site by removing soil, often after softening it with collected water, to allow for nest enlargement. Foraging for food entails seeking protein to feed the developing larvae such as arthropod prey and carrion, and carbohydrates for adults such as nectar, tree sap, fruit and honey dew.

As the nest develops, more combs are added below the original queen-built comb, suspended by stout carton pillars and the outer, insulating envelope is re-cycled as the nest grows larger. By late summer the nest is about the size of a football with several thousand adult workers in the colony. At this time, queen-rearing cells, which are twice the volume of the worker cells, are constructed and the new queens and also males (which may be reared in both worker and queen cells) are produced.

After feeding and laying down quantities of body fat, the young queens leave the nest, mate and then finally seek hibernation quarters where they will remain until spring.",2021-04-05 16:30:50

Description: Common Wasp, Vespula vulgaris.

There are approximately 9,000 species of wasp in the UK, 250 of these are the larger wasps which have have a stinger. Only nine of these are social wasps which form large nests, the majority are solitary.

The Common wasp is found throughout the UK in almost all habitats, including woodland and urban areas and is easily  identified by most people by it's striking black and yellow stripes. 

Adult workers, always female, measure 12-17mm whereas the queen is around 20mm. 
The iconic black and yellow stripes give a clear warning to other animals that these insects are dangerous. 
Wasps have a sting to allow them to capture and immobilise their prey such as aphids, caterpillars, spiders and flies, (as in this image). They may also sting to defend their nest.
 
With the abdomen split into six segments, one black/yellow stripe on each, the Common wasp is very similar to the German wasp, Vespula germanica. 
The key difference is that Common wasps lack the three black dots on the head and distinct black dots on the back as they merge with the black stripes.

In late spring the large queens can be seen looking for suitable nest sites. These can be deserted mammal holes, cracks in walls or holes in trees or in buildings. 
The nests are made from chewed up wood and wasp saliva which creates a paper-like material.

A queen will begin by building a cylindrical column known as a petiole which is covered by a chemical produced by the queen which repels ants. When she’s finished, she produces a single cell and surrounds it with a further six cells, giving the cells their characteristic hexagonal shape. She continues building cells in a layer until she has 20-30 then lays an egg in each. 

After about 30 days, her first offspring – the workers – emerge as adults. They are all female at this point. The workers takeover the foraging, brood care and nest building and maintenance duties.

After a few days the carnivorous larvae will hatch from the newest eggs. The adult workers bring insects back to the nest to feed to the larvae, which offer a sugary reward to the workers, via a process called trophallaxis. 
The larvae grow over a couple of weeks before they spin their pupal cap and pupate.

Over the next couple of months, the colony will grow to include thousands of wasps. 

Once the colony is big enough, the queen will switch to laying a sexual brood. These are males and the sexual females which are capable of becoming next year’s queens.

Towards the end of September the nests are at maximum capacity, with lots of adults and few larvae. This means that there will be lots of wasps visible but also affects what food they look for. 
While the adults feed on nectar the larvae are fed on insects. With fewer larvae the adults don’t need to look for as much protein but do need more sugars and carbohydrates. It is at this time they can be seen feeding on fallen fruit and when they may become bothersome to humans.

When the sexual brood emerges, they leave the nest to mate and then find somewhere to hibernate over the winter. After this point, the nest has served its purpose. 
Colonies only last one year and once the new queens depart all the other wasps in the colony will eventually die.",2021-04-05 16:30:56

<b>Michael Douglas</b> (1944) is an American actor-producer best known for his roles in films like <i>Wall Street</i> (1987), <i>Fatal Attraction</i> (1987) and <i>Basic Instinct</i> (1992). The elder son of Kirk Douglas gained fame after starring in the police series <i>Streets of San Francisco</i> (1972–1977). Douglas branched out into independent feature production in 1975 with the acclaimed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), for which he won an Oscar as one of the film's producers. Starring roles followed in <i>The China Syndrome</i> (1979), <i>Romancing the Stone</i> (1984) and <i>Wall Street</i> (1987), for which he won his second Oscar. Later films include <i>Traffic</i> (2000), <i>Wonder Boys</i> (2000), the Emmy Award-winning <i>Behind the Candelabra</i> (2013), and <i>Ant-Man</i> (2015).

Michael Kirk Douglas was born in 1944, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to actor Kirk Douglas and his wife, Diana Dill. Douglas grew up with three brothers: Joel, Peter, and Eric. Douglas's parents divorced when he was six, and he went to live with his mother and her new husband. Only seeing Kirk on holidays, Michael attended Eaglebrook school in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he was about a year younger than all of his classmates. Douglas's strained relationship with his father developed more as he progressed through life. He studied drama at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and in New York at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and the American Place Theatre. Douglas began his Hollywood career as an assistant director on some of his father's 1960s films. Michael made his film debut in his father's film Cast a Giant Shadow (Melville Shavelson, 1966). He played roles in several television dramas, including the leading role in the adaptation of John Weston's controversial novel, Hail, Hero! (David Miller, 1969). His performance earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Male Newcomer. Douglas became well-known by co-starring with Karl Malden in the TV series The Streets of San Francisco (1972-1977). The police series became one of ABC's highest-rated prime-time programs in the mid-1970s. Douglas earned three successive Emmy Award nominations for his performance and he directed two episodes of the show. In 1975, Douglas served as executive producer for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Milos Forman, 1975), which went on to win five Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture. The film grossed more than $180 million at the box office. He got involved in the film after his father, who owned the rights to Ken Kesey's novel of the same name, couldn't successfully develop it into a film. Despite the success of the film, it was difficult for Douglas to find work as an actor, having received so much recognition as a producer. After leaving The Streets of San Francisco in 1976, Douglas played a hospital doctor in the medical thriller Coma (Michael Crichton, 1978). He then co-produced and co-starred with Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon in The China Syndrome (James Bridges, 1979), a drama about a nuclear power plant accident. In 1980, Douglas was involved in a serious skiing accident that sidelined his acting career for three years. 

Michael Douglas became a star with his leading role in tongue-in-cheek romantic fantasy Romancing the Stone (Robert Zemeckis, 1984). He portrayed Jack Colton, an Indiana Jones-type adventurer. His successful teaming with Danny DeVito and Kathleen Turner led to a sequel, The Jewel of the Nile (Lewis Teague, 1985). The three worked again in The War of the Roses (Danny DeVito, 1989), a dark comedy about an ugly divorce. In 1987, Douglas made two films that reflected a much darker side: Fatal Attraction (Adrian Lyne, 1987), in which he played an adulterer stalked by an ex-lover — played by Glenn Close — and Wall Street (Oliver Stone, 1987), in which he played the corporate raider Gordon Gekko, whose trademark slogan is &quot;Greed is good.&quot; For this role, Douglas won an Academy Award for Best Actor. He continued exploring his dark side years later, in the thriller Basic Instinct (Paul Verhoeven, 1992), co-starring Sharon Stone. The film was a box office hit and sparked controversy over its depictions of bisexuality and lesbianism. In 1988, Douglas formed a production company, Stonebridge Entertainment, Inc., which produced  Flatliners (Joel Schumacher, 1990) and Radio Flyer (Richard Donner,  1992). In 1992, he began a 30-day treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction at Sierra Tucson Center. Douglas gave one of his most powerful performances opposite Robert Duvall in Joel Schumacher's controversial drama Falling Down (1993). That year, he produced Made in America (1993), then starred as a sexually harassed man in Disclosure (Barry Levinson, 1994),  based on the bestseller by Michael Crichton, and as the titular commander-in-chief in The American President (Rob Reiner, 1995), co-starring Annette Bening.

In 1994, Michael Douglas signed a development deal at Paramount that included The Ghost and the Darkness (Stephen Hopkins, 1996), The Game (David Fincher, 1997), and A Perfect Murder (Andrew Davis, 1998). He executive produced The Rainmaker (Francis Ford Coppola, 1997), starring Matt Damon, as well as the action film, Face/Off (John Woo, 1997) with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. Douglas earned critical acclaim for his starring role as a rumpled professor and novelist suffering from writer's block in Wonder Boys (Curtis Hanson, 2000). In Traffic (Steven Soderbergh, 2000), Douglas played Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar confronted by the drug war both at home and abroad. Traffic was named Best Picture by New York Film Critics and won four Oscars. Douglas then headlined the psychological thriller Don't Say a Word (Gary Fleder, 2001), co-starring Brittany Murphy. He featured alongside his famous father, his mother, and his son, Cameron in It Runs in the Family (2003), about a multi-generational clan trying to get along. The film fared poorly at the box office. In 2004 Michael and Kirk filmed the intimate HBO documentary 'A Father, A Son... Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'. Directed by award-winning filmmaker Lee Grant, the documentary examines the professional and personal lives of both men, and the impacts they each made on the film industry. In 2010, Douglas announced that he would be reprising his role as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps (Oliver Stone, 2010), also starring Shia LaBeouf and Carey Mulligan. Douglas went on to work on the biopic Behind the Candelabra (Steven Soderbergh, 2013), starring in the film as the famous 1950s and 1960s entertainer Liberace. Matt Damon played his partner Scott Thorson in the critically acclaimed 2013 television film. Douglas won an Emmy Award for his role. He also filmed Last Vegas (John Turtletaub, 2013) with Robert De Niro. In the following years, Douglas starred opposite Diane Keaton in And So It Goes (Rob Reiner, 2014) and the Marvel superhero action/comedy Ant-Man (Peyton Reed, 2015) opposite Paul Rudd. He reprised his role as biochemist Hank Pym in the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp (Peyton Reed, 2018) and also appeared in the superhero film Avengers: Endgame (Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, 2019.) In 1977, Michael Douglas married Diandra Luker They had one son, Cameron, but were separated in 1995 and later divorced. In 2000, Douglas married Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, his Traffic co-star. The couple welcomed a son, Dylan Michael Douglas, in 2000, followed by daughter Carys Zeta Douglas in 2003. In 2013, Douglas and Zeta-Jones separated after more than 12 years of marriage, but they reconciled in 2014. Outside of his busy acting career, Douglas is active in promoting human rights. His work in this area includes serving as a United Nations messenger of peace. Douglas currently stars as an aging acting coach in Chuck Lorre's comedy series The Kominsky Method, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, and in the Netflix series Green Eggs and Ham, where he voices Guy-Am-I.

Description:    The P-47 Thunderbolt, which would become one of the most successful and widely produced fighters in history, began as the brainchild of two Russian aircraft designers who fled the Soviet Union—Alexander de Seversky and Alexander Kartveli.  Kartveli had begun designing fighters for Seversky, including the P-35, and staying on with Seversky Aircraft after it was renamed Republic Aviation.  Kartveli had designed the radial-engined P-43 Lancer and P-44 Rocket, and was working on the inline-engined XP-47 when the US Army Air Force cancelled all three programs in 1940, citing that they were inferior to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109.  

   Kartveli then proposed a new design based on the P-43/44, but much larger, with a turbocharged R-2800 Double Wasp engine, one of the most powerful radials available at the time.  The size of the turbocharger and the engine meant that the fuselage had to be much larger as well; as the USAAF wanted an eight-gun fighter along the lines of the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane, the new design was equipped with elliptical wings containing eight .50 caliber machine guns.  The resulting design, designated XP-47B Thunderbolt, was huge: it was 65 percent heavier than the P-43 and nearly twice the weight of the Spitfire.  Even Kartveli himself referred to it as a “dinosaur.”  When pilots saw it, they thought that its size and shape (and likely, its flying characteristics) resembled that of a milk jug, forever earning the Thunderbolt its moniker of “Jug.”  Though the first XP-47B prototype crashed soon after its first flight in May 1941, its speed and performance were impressive.

    Minor problems with the P-47B production version led to the P-47C, the first combat-ready version of  the Thunderbolt, which arrived in England in January 1943.  Assigned to the 4th Fighter Group, whose pilots were used to flying Spitfires, initially the Thunderbolt seemed a failure.  It could not turn with either the Bf 109 or the new Focke-Wulf 190, and its climbing ability left much to be desired. Pilots hated the Thunderbolt’s size, its lack of performance as compared with the Spitfire, and its low ground clearance, though they did appreciate the comfortable and roomy cockpit, and especially the armor around it.

  The indifferent performance of the P-47C and high accident rate led Republic to refine the design in the definitive P-47D variant, which introduced better cooling for the engine and, most importantly, paddle-bladed propeller blades.  Now the Thunderbolt began to prove Kartveli’s faith in the fighter.  The 56th Fighter Group, led by Hubert Zemke, had been trained from the start in the P-47 and benefited from earlier experience.  Zemke, assisted by future aces Francis Gabreski and Robert Johnson, developed ambush tactics that emphasized the Thunderbolt’s advantage in weight; the P-47D’s improved engine and propeller gave it an edge over the Luftwaffe over 15,000 feet that the Germans were not able to equal until the introduction of the Messerschmitt 262 jet in 1944.  This was a huge advantage for USAAF pilots, as the majority of air combat over Germany took place at altitudes of 20,000 feet.  While the P-51 Mustang was more maneuverable, longer-ranged, and better in the vertical, it was Gabreski and Johnson, in their P-47s, who became the top American aces in Europe.  In response to pilots complaining about the lack of rear vision in the “razorback” P-47D, Republic introduced the “bubbletop” version, which cut down the rear fuselage and added a P-51 style bubble canopy, giving the Thunderbolt pilot superb visibility.  

   What endeared the Thunderbolt to its pilots, however, was its legendary toughness.  Since it was far more survivable than the inline-engined P-38 and P-51, much of the European Theater’s P-47s were shifted away from bomber escort and to 9th Air Force’s ground-attack force.  Armed with rockets, bombs, and their eight machine guns, Thunderbolts proved to be devastating in this role, attacking anything that moved in Western Europe: by war’s end, ground attack P-47s had destroyed over 6000 tanks; it was especially deadly to trains, accounting for 9000 locomotives.  3752 German fighters became victims of P-47 pilots in the air.  P-47Ds also served in the Pacific theater, though in fewer numbers compared to the P-38; nonetheless, they also turned in a stellar combat record, and the third highest ranking ace in the Pacific, Neel Kearby, was a Thunderbolt pilot.  Allied air forces also flew P-47s, including the RAF (mainly in the Pacific), and expeditionary units of the Brazilian and Mexican Air Forces.

    After war’s end, though more advanced “Pacific” versions of the Thunderbolt had been introduced in the P-47M/N, it was rapidly retired from service in favor of jets (namely the F-84 Thunderjet) and the P-51.  A few lingered on until 1953 in Air National Guard service, when it was retired.  France used a few P-47s during the Algerian War of Independence in the mid-1950s, while it persisted in South American air forces into the late 1960s.  In 1993, Croatia seriously considered returning a museum-piece P-47 to active service during the Croat-Serbian War.  15,686 P-47s were produced, making it second only to the P-51 in US service; today, about 47 survive.

Though not much to look at for the moment, this is P-47D 42-8074, once assigned to the 348th Fighter Group at Finschafen, New Guinea.  In September 1943, it was badly damaged in a landing accident at the airfield, and used as a spare parts source.  When World War II ended, it--along with several other aircraft--was simply bulldozed into a pit at Finschafen and abandoned.  

With all the &quot;easy&quot; restorations of World War II-era aircraft largely completed by the 1990s, warbird collectors turned to looking for wrecks that could be, with considerable cost and work, still be restored to at least display status, and possibly flyable status.  A group of Australian warbird collectors located the Finschafen pit in 2002, and this proved to be a gold mine: three P-47s and two P-38s were recovered.  They were shipped to Australia, where they were bought by Microsoft co-founded (and legendary warbird collector and explorer) Paul Allen for his Flying Heritage Collection.  Allen turned over 42-8074 to Westpac Restorations of Colorado Springs for restoration in 2004.

Despite being buried in New Guinea for over 60 years, 42-8074 is in remarkable condition, with faint hints of the 1943-era red-surround national insignia still intact.  Paul Allen's passing and the closure of the FHC in 2020 have left 42-8074's future somewhat in limbo; it will likely remain at its present location, the National Museum of World War II Aviation, for the foreseeable future.  The plan is to fully restore the aircraft.  ",2021-04-05 16:31:18

This P-47D is 45-49385, which was delivered to the USAAF less than a month before World War II ended.  Deemed obsolete, it may have gone into storage immediately, or possibly served with an Air National Guard unit until 1953, when it was supplied to the Peruvian Air Force.  It was retired in 1963, and once more went back into storage until 1969, when it was acquired by a warbird collector and shipped back to the United States.

45-49385 was restored back to flyable condition by 1973, and joined the Confederate (now Commemorative) Air Force, but was only with the CAF a year before being acquired by the Chino, California based Military Aircraft Restoration Corporation (MARC).  45-49385 suffered a crash in 1980 that led to six years of restoration, then went on display at the Mid-America Air Museum in Liberal, Kansas until 1990.  Returning to Chino that year, it crashed again (though with less damage this time), and would be out of action until 1993.  Finally, in 2004, it was acquired by Westpac Aviation, which did yet another restoration job, this time with original P-47 parts, including a turbocharger--making 45-49385 one of only three P-47s with a functioning one.  

Since then, it's been part of the National Museum of World War II Aviation's collection, displayed (and still flyable) as an aircraft of the 78th Fighter Group, based at RAF Duxford, complete with invasion stripes.  I saw 45-49385 in August 2020. ",2021-04-05 16:31:19

<u>High Wycombe</u>

High Wycombe, often referred to simply as Wycombe, is a large market town in Buckinghamshire. Lying in the valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills, it is 29 miles (47 km) west north-west of Charing Cross in London; this information is also engraved on the Corn Market building in the centre of the town. 

In 2016, High Wycombe had a population of 125,260, and is the second largest town in the county of Buckinghamshire after Milton Keynes. .

Wycombe is a combination of industrial and market town, with a traditional emphasis on furniture production. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the Middle Ages. The market is held on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

<u>History of High Wycombe</u>

Wycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th.-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.

High Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and Tudor times, manufacturing lace and linen cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.

The paper industry was notable in 17th. and 18th. century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. However the paper industry was overtaken by the cloth industry.

Wycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly Windsor chairs), took hold in the 19th. century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. 

In 1875, there were 4,700 chairs being made per day in High Wycombe. When Queen Victoria visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words 'Long Live the Queen' printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. 

Wycombe Museum includes many examples of locally made chairs along with information on the local furniture and lace industries.

The town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960's.

<u>High Wycombe in the 20th. Century</u>

By the 1920's, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A slum clearance scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents re-housed in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes. 

Some of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation, with sewage pouring down the street and people sharing one room in cramped quarters of subdivided flats. However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th. and 19th. century architecture.

From 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of RAF Bomber Command. Moreover, during the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force's 8th. Air Force Bomber Command, code-named 'Pinetree', was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe. 

In the 1960's the town centre was redeveloped. This involved culverting the River Wye under concrete and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe's town centre. Two shopping centres were built along with many new multi-storey car parks, office blocks, flyovers and roundabouts. On the open area known as Frogmoor (or Frogmore) the original cast-iron fountain and some Georgian buildings were also torn down. (...Sounds as if they ruined the town centre).

Although situated in the county of Buckinghamshire, which is one of the more affluent parts of the country, Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas. In 2007, a GMB Union survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th. dirtiest in the South East, and the 26th. dirtiest in the whole of the UK. The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways.

<u>High Wycombe Politics</u>

Wycombe's political history extends back to 1295. 

The Wycombe Constituency has continuously elected Conservative Members of Parliament since 1951.

High Wycombe has been home to two Prime Ministers:

- The Earl of Shelburne lived at what is now Wycombe Abbey. 

- Benjamin Disraeli, who lived at nearby Hughenden Manor, was defeated as an independent candidate in 1832, but won the election in 1868 and 1874-1880 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel on the High Street (now Iceland/Bargain buys). 

Although the hotel has gone, the portico with the red lion on top has survived - you can just about see it on the right, beyond the yellow car.

<u>Weighing the Mayor</u>

A ceremony carried out in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. 

The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th. century. When the result is known, the town crier announces &quot;And No More!&quot; if the mayor has not gained weight, or &quot;And Some More!&quot; if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.

<u>Media Coverage of High Wycombe</u>

High Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including:

- Coverage of the local library's refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster.

- The triple shooting of three young Asian men.

- A small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used whilst a gunman sprayed bullets.

- The shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at point-blank range in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.

- The town appeared in national and international media after anti-terrorism raids were carried out as part of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town's Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A small number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.

- On the 21st. December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks. Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight.

How to create a shelter that attracts native pollinators to your yard
Last winter my wife sent me a link to an article on insekthotels (“insect hotels”) from a popular German nature website. If you’re not familiar with these (don’t feel bad, I wasn’t either), they’re basically the same as a birdhouse except for insects instead of birds. And, like a birdhouse, there’s all kinds of design options based on the insects you’re trying to attract.
The insect hotels in the article were huge and elaborate pieces of art, built like Alpine chateaus, castles and sod-covered hobbit houses. Nice to look at, but nothing I was going to imitate (too fancy and I don’t do fancy), but they did look cool, so I decided to learn more about them.
What Lives Here?
The first thing I learned was you need to know what kind of insects live around you. If you don’t, you might end up spending a whole bunch of time building nests for bugs that live only in Northern Europe even though your hotel is in Southern California.
After schooling myself on the locals who might be guests for my hotel, I decided that most of the bugs have plenty of nesting space in the surrounding area. Native bees, however, are having trouble, so I decided to make my hotel bee-centric (though not bee-exclusive — all insects are welcome).
Building a Bee Hotel for the Western United States

Our Bees
The West coast of North America as well as Arizona, New Mexico and the northern states of Mexico are home to many varieties of native bees — up to 1,600 distinct species by some estimates. Most of these bees are solitary or live in small colonies. There is no queen, no massive hive, or stinging like there is with the European honey bee.
It’s no surprise that bees living in the arid climate of the west are for the most part ground-dwellers and lay their eggs in burrows or tunnels. A few, however, nest in wood, which is much harder to come by. Here in the bottom left hand corner of America, there are three species we see on a regular basis:
<a href=""https://i2.wp.com/arboretum.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk1546/files/inline-images/mason-bee.png?ssl=1"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""></a>photo credit: UC Davis Public Garden and Arboretum
<strong>Mason bee (Osmia Californica)</strong>
These guys are a smaller bee — about the size of a honey bee — but usually darker without the pronounced yellow stripes. Solitary and non-aggressive, they’re called mason bees because they use mud to seal the cocoon and some pollen for food in small cavities.

<a href=""https://i2.wp.com/arboretum.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk1546/files/inline-images/valley-carpenter-bee.png?ssl=1"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""></a>photo credit: UC Davis Public Garden and Arboretum
<strong>California Carpenter Bee (Xylocopa californica)</strong>
This is the big, black shiny show moving bee we were all scared of as kids. Despite it’s badass looks, it’s actually very docile and a great pollinator because of the sheer amount of pollen it can carry. (Seriously. If a honey bee is a hatchback car, a carpenter bee is more like a 30-foot semi tractor-trailer.) It’s known as the carpenter bee because it hollows out old and rotting wood in which to lay its eggs.

<a href=""https://i1.wp.com/arboretum.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk1546/files/inline-images/leafcutter-bee.png?ssl=1"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""></a>photo credit: UC Davis Public Garden and Arboretum
<strong>Leafcutter bee, (Megachilidae ssp.)</strong>
A cousin of the mason bee, this one likes to line its nesting tubes with pieces of leaf it cuts (thus the name). It carries its pollen on the underside of its abdomen instead of the legs like a honeybee. To pick up pollen it uses a swishy side-to-side motion sort of like a Swiffer Sweeper, so it’s really good at spreading the pollen around. (It’s probably a great way to scratch and itch too.)

Designing the Bee Hotel
Since these native bees are all wood nesters I decided to skip using bricks and pottery like other insect hotels and use only wood and/or reeds for the “rooms” in the hotel. Otherwise, I stuck pretty much to the suggested rules — at least 3 feet from the ground, 9 to 12 inches deep, and a variety of woods and nesting cavity sizes.
For the construction materials I didn’t want to buy anything, so I used leftover wood reclaimed from some other projects. The hotel frame was made from some pressure treated 2x4s from an old landscaping project and some 1×10 pine boards salvaged from a built in bookcase I’d recently torn out. The wood and reed “rooms” would be made from logs from the wood pile and dried arundo, which is an invasive cane from the Mediterranean that grows in the creek bottom nearby.
<a href=""https://i1.wp.com/sagesacre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-bee-hotel-sketch.jpg?ssl=1"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""></a>The original bee hotel plans
My original design was a narrow building, 6 feet tall with an A-frame roof like I’d seen in the German article, but it turned out to be highly unstable, so I switched to a shed roof made from some corrugated steel panel that hung off the back far enough to act as a counter balance as well as give some shade and rain cover to the back of the hotel. After that, it was pretty much just a matter of cutting the wood and screwing and gluing the hotel together.

Building the Bee Hotel
For the upper portion of the hotel, I built a box that was 36-in x 20½-in x 9½-in (basically two shelf boards cut to 36 inches and placed side-by-side) and used the remainder of my shelving to subdivide the box into two large and three small “rooms”.

Then I took my four 6-foot PT 2x4s and screwed them on to the box to make the legs.
For the roof, I used some scrap 2×4 to create the frame and mounted a 36-inch piece of leftover corrugated steel panel to it. Then I popped that and the top of the hotel and secured it.
After I had the roof mounted, I attached a piece of cedar fence board to the front to finish off the upper compartments and painted the whole thing with some barn red primer.

Once the paint dried I carried the hotel down to the lower yard and stood it up in an area that I’m turning into a “poultry-friendly” Mediterranean garden (which is more difficult than it sounds).
Now that it was stood up, I drilled ½-inch,5/8-inch and ¾-inch holes in a variety of wood logs — oak for the critters that like the hardwoods, and pine and agave stalk, for those that like burrowing in the soft wood. Then I cut up Arundo cane for the tube dwellers, and drilled some redwood blocks for the smaller bees that like orderly condo living.

Occupying the Bee Hotel
I built the bee hotel in spring because I knew the bees wouldn’t be looking for nesting sites until late summer and early fall. Since my potential guests are all fans of old and rotting wood, I figured 4-6 months would ensure that the “new bee hotel” smell would be gone by then.
Over the months I’ve inspected the hotel now and again to see who’s taken up residence. I spotted a couple of tunnel spiders (love those reeds), a mud wasp, and a little fence lizard, but never any native bees. From my reading, this was normal. Many people said they didn’t get any bees even years later, so I wasn’t too surprised to not see any myself (It’s not like there’s a Yelp for bees to find hotels near them).
But then yesterday, I went down to the hotel to grab a couple of quick photos for this post, when I spotted this.
Yep, that’s a carpenter bee who’s making herself at home in an agave log (¾-inch hole – they’re big)!
Closer inspection revealed that at least three logs are occupied (as evidenced by the sawdust being kicked out of the holes), but I’m hoping by the time fall rolls around a lot more of the spots will be taken as well. But even if they aren’t, I’m still really happy with the success of this bee hotel in its first year of operation.
If you’ve ever thought about building one of these for your own native bees, I highly recommend it. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as knowing that all kinds of nature finds home in your garden.

<u>High Wycombe</u>

High Wycombe, often referred to simply as Wycombe, is a large market town in Buckinghamshire. Lying in the valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills, it is 29 miles (47 km) west north-west of Charing Cross in London; this information is also engraved on the Corn Market building in the centre of the town. 

In 2016, High Wycombe had a population of 125,260, and is the second largest town in the county of Buckinghamshire after Milton Keynes.

Wycombe is a combination of industrial and market town, with a traditional emphasis on furniture production. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the Middle Ages. The market is held on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

<u>History of High Wycombe</u>

Wycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th.-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.

High Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and Tudor times, manufacturing lace and linen cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.

The paper industry was notable in 17th. and 18th. century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. However the paper industry was overtaken by the cloth industry.

Wycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly Windsor chairs), took hold in the 19th. century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. 

In 1875, there were 4,700 chairs being made per day in High Wycombe. When Queen Victoria visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words 'Long Live the Queen' printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. 

Wycombe Museum includes many examples of locally made chairs along with information on the local furniture and lace industries.

The town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960's.

<u>High Wycombe in the 20th. Century</u>

By the 1920's, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A slum clearance scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents re-housed in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes. 

Some of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation, with sewage pouring down the street and people sharing one room in cramped quarters of subdivided flats. However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th. and 19th. century architecture.

From 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of RAF Bomber Command. Moreover, during the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force's 8th. Air Force Bomber Command, code-named 'Pinetree', was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe. 

In the 1960's the town centre was redeveloped. This involved culverting the River Wye under concrete and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe's town centre. Two shopping centres were built along with many new multi-storey car parks, office blocks, flyovers and roundabouts. On the open area known as Frogmoor (or Frogmore) the original cast-iron fountain and some Georgian buildings were also torn down. (...Sounds as if they ruined the town centre).

Although situated in the county of Buckinghamshire, which is one of the more affluent parts of the country, Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas. In 2007, a GMB Union survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th. dirtiest in the South East, and the 26th. dirtiest in the whole of the UK. The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways.

<u>High Wycombe Politics</u>

Wycombe's political history extends back to 1295. 

The Wycombe Constituency has continuously elected Conservative Members of Parliament since 1951.

High Wycombe has been home to two Prime Ministers:

- The Earl of Shelburne lived at what is now Wycombe Abbey. 

- Benjamin Disraeli, who lived at nearby Hughenden Manor, was defeated as an independent candidate in 1832, but won the election in 1868 and 1874-1880 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel on the High Street (now Iceland/Bargain buys). 

Although the hotel has gone, the portico with the red lion on top has survived - you can just about see it on the right, beyond the yellow car.

<u>Weighing the Mayor</u>

A ceremony carried out in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. 

The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th. century. When the result is known, the town crier announces &quot;And No More!&quot; if the mayor has not gained weight, or &quot;And Some More!&quot; if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.

<u>Media Coverage of High Wycombe</u>

High Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including:

- Coverage of the local library's refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster.

- The triple shooting of three young Asian men.

- A small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used whilst a gunman sprayed bullets.

- The shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at point-blank range in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.

- The town appeared in national and international media after anti-terrorism raids were carried out as part of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town's Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.

- On the 21st. December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks. Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight.

Distribution.

This beetle is widespread in most of Europe, in East Palearctic ecozone and in the Near East (Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Corsica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Sardinia, Serbia, Sicily, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey, United Kingdom).

Description.
Rutpela maculata – mating pair
The adults grow up to 13–20 millimetres (0.51–0.79 in). The head and pronotum are dark-brown, while elytra are yellowish, with black dots and stripes, rough imitations of wasps, which probably gives them some protection from birds.

Biology
Adults can be encountered from May through August, completing their life cycle in two-three years. They only live two-four weeks. They are very common flower-visitors, especially Apiaceae species, feeding on pollen and the nectar. Larvae are polyphagous in deciduous trees, mainly feeding on Picea abies, Corylus avellana, Fagus sylvatica, Castanea sativa and Ostrya carpinifolia, as well as on Quercus, Carpinus, Salix, Alnus, Populus and Betula species.


Beschrijving-
De kever is makkelijk te herkennen aan het langwerpige, naar achteren versmalde achterlijf, en een gele kleur met donkerbruine tot zwarte vlekken. Vaak is er sprake van vier rijen vlekken, die echter naar het achtereind toe steeds meer samensmelten tot banden; de laatste twee rijen zijn dus eerder dwarsstrepen. Deze vlekken zijn echter onregelmatig van patroon, en er is ook een vierbandsmalbok (Leptura quadrifasciata), die soms een overlappend kleurenpatroon heeft, maar meestal geel met zwart gebandeerd is. Beide soorten imiteren wespen om aan belagers te ontkomen, dit wordt ook wel mimicry genoemd.
De kop en het borststuk zijn zwart, en de poten erg sprieterig. De tasters zijn zoals veel andere soorten boktorren ongeveer even lang als het hele lijf en hebben na elk segment een lichtere, vaak gele tot rode kleur. De lengte zonder de lange tasters is ongeveer 25 millimeter.

Voorkomen en voedsel-
Deze kever leeft van mei tot september en eet bloemdelen van voornamelijk schermbloemigen maar ook wel andere soorten planten. Ook de larve is polyfaag en eet vermolmd hout van diverse loofbomen, onder andere van de wilg, de beuk en de populier. De habitat bestaat uit loofbossen en bosranden, buiten bosrijke gebieden wordt deze soort niet vaak aangetroffen.",2021-04-05 16:31:38

Herb.
This common garden mint is not a native of these islands, though growing freely in every garden, but is originally a native of the Mediterranean region, and was introduced into Britain by the Romans, being largely cultivated not only by them, but also by the other Mediterranean nations. It was in great request by the Romans, and Pliny according to Gerard says of it: 'The smell of Mint does stir up the mind and the taste to a greedy desire of meate.' Ovid represents the hospitable Baucis and Philemon scouring their board with green mint before laying upon it the food intended for their divine guests. The Ancients believed that mint would prevent the coagulation of milk and its acid fermentation. Gerard, again quoting Pliny, says:
'It will not suffer milk to cruddle in the stomach, and therefore it is put in milk that is drunk, lest those that drink thereof should be strangled.'
Many other references to it in old writings - among them, that of the payment by the Pharisees of tithes of Mint, Anise and Cumin - prove that the herb has been highly esteemed for many centuries. Mint is mentioned in all early mediaeval lists of plants; it was very early grown in English gardens, and was certainly cultivated in the Convent gardens of the ninth century. Chaucer refers to 'a little path of mint's full and fennell greene. '
Turner states in his Herball (1568) that the garden mint of his time was also called 'Spere Mynte.' Gerard, in further praise of the herb, tells us that: 'the smell rejoiceth the heart of man, for which cause they used to strew it in chambers and places of recreation, pleasure and repose, where feasts and banquets are made.'
  It has, in fact, been so universally esteemed, that it is to be found wild in nearly all the countries to which civilization has extended, and in America for 200 years it has been known as an escape from gardens, growing in moist soils and proving sometimes troublesome as a weed.
Parkinson, in his Garden of Pleasure, mentions 'divers sorts of mint's both of the garden and wilde, of the woods, mountain and standing pools or waters' and says:
'Mint's are sometimes used in Baths with Balm and other herbs as a help to comfort and strengthen the nerves and sinews. It is much used either outwardly applied or inwardly drunk to strengthen and comfort weak stomachs.'
The Ancients used mint to scent their bath water and as a restorative, as we use smelling salts to-day. In Athens where every part of the body was perfumed with a different scent mint was specially designated to the arms.
Gerard says of its medicinal properties:
'It is good against watering eyes and all manner of breakings out on the head and sores. It is applied with salt to the bitings of mad dogs.... They lay it on the stinging of wasps and bees with good success.'
Culpepper gives nearly forty distinct maladies for which mint is 'singularly good.'
'Being smelled into,' he says, 'it is comfortable for the head and memory, and a decoction when used as a gargle, cures the mouth and gums, when sore.' Again, 'Garden Mint is most useful to wash children's heads when the latter are inclined to sores, and Wild Mint, mixed with vinegar is an excellent wash to get rid of scurf. Rose leaves and mint, heated and applied outwardly cause rest and sleep.'
  In the fourteenth century, mint was used for whitening the teeth, and its distilled oil is still used to flavour tooth-pastes, etc., and in America, especially, to flavour confectionery, chewing gums, and also to perfume soap.
 Mint otto's have more power than any other aromatic to overcome the smell of tobacco.
 The application of a strong decoction of Spearmint is said to cure chapped hands.
 Mice are so averse to the smell of mint, either fresh or dried, that they will leave untouched any food where it is scattered. As mice love Henbane and often prove very destructive to a crop, it has been suggested that their depredations might be checked if some mint were planted between the rows of Henbane.
 It is probable that Spearmint was introduced by the Pilgrim Fathers when they landed in America, as it is mentioned among many other plants brought out from England, in a list given by John Josselyn. When in this country apparently found growing wild, it occurs in watery places, but is rather rare.
 Professor Henslow (Origin and History of our Garden Vegetables) does not consider it truly native to any country. He says:
'The Garden Mint (Mentha viridis, Linn.) is a cultivated form of M. sylvestris (Linn.), the Horse Mint, which is recorded as cultivated at Aleppo. Either M. sylvestris, or some form approaching M. viridis, which is not known as a truly wild plant, was probably the mint of Scripture.'
Bentham also considers it not improbably a variety of M. sylvestris, perpetuated through its ready propagation by suckers, and though these two plants are sufficiently distinct as found in England, yet continental forms occur which bridge over their differences.
Its generic name, Mentha, is derived from the mythological origin ascribed to it, and was originally applied to the mint by Theophrastus. Menthe was a nymph, who because of the love Pluto bore her, was metamorphosed by Proserpine, from motives of jealousy, into the plant we now call mint

Description---From creeping root-stocks, erect, square stems rise to a height of about 2 feet, bearing very short-stalked, acute-pointed, lance-shaped, wrinkled, bright green leaves, with finely toothed edges and smooth surfaces, the ribs very prominent beneath. The small flowers are densely arranged in whorls or rings in the axils of the upper leaves, forming cylindrical, slender, tapering spikes, pinkish or lilac in colour. The little labiate flowers are followed by very few, roundish, minute brown seeds. The taste and odour of the plant are very characteristic.

There are several forms of Garden Mint, the true variety being of bold, upright growth, with fairly large and broad leaves, pointed and sharply serrated (or toothed) at the edges and of a rich, bright, green colour. Another variety, sometimes sold as Spearmint (M. cardiaca), is much smaller and less erect in growth, with darker leaves, the whorls of flowers distant and leafy, but possessing the same odour and flavour, and another has comparatively large, broad or rounded leaves. Yet another has soft hairs, but this, though distinct from what is known as Horse Mint, is inferior to the true Spearmint.
Cultivation---A moist situation is preferable, but mint will succeed in almost any soil when once started into growth, though in dry, sandy soils it is sometimes difficult to grow, and should be planted in the coolest and dampest situations. Leaf mould, road scrapings, burnt ash and similar materials should, on the other hand, be used freely for lightening heavy, tenacious soils. It does best in a partially shaded position: if in a sheltered spot, it will start earlier in the spring than if exposed. Where a long or regular supply is required, it is a good plan to have at least one bed in a sunny and sheltered, and another in a shady position, where gatherings may be made both early and late.
 As the plant is a perennial, spreading by means of its underground, creeping stems propagation may be easily effected by lifting the roots in February or March, dividing them - every piece showing a joint will grow - and planting again in shallow trenches, covering with 2 inches of soil. Six inches apart in the rows and 8 inches between the rows are the right distances to allow. Cuttings in summer or offsets in spring may also be utilized for increasing a stock. Cuttings may be taken at almost any time during the summer, always choosing the young shoots, these being struck on a shady border of light soil and kept moist, or a better plan, if possible, is to insert them in a frame, keeping them close and moist till rooted. Cuttings or young shoots will also strike freely in good-sized boxes in a heated greenhouse, in the early spring, and after the tops have been taken off two or three times for use, the plants may be hardened off and planted outside.
 The beds are much benefited by an annual top-dressing of rich soil, applied towards the close of autumn, when all remaining stalks should be cut down to the ground. A liberal top-dressing of short, decayed manure, such as that from an old hot-bed or mushroom bed, annually, either in the spring, when it commences to grow, or better still, perhaps, after the first or second cutting, will ensure luxuriant growth. Frequent cuttings of shoots constitute a great drain on the plants, and if not properly nourished they will fail, more or less. To have really good mint, the plantation should be re-made about every three years, or failing that, it is essential that a good top-dressing of rich soil be added.
 A good stock should be kept up, so that plenty may be available for forcing. Cultivators having a greenhouse can easily force mint into an earlier development of new growth than would be in the open garden. Forcing is very easy, the only preparation being the insertion of a quantity of good roots in a box of light soil, which should be placed in a temperature of about 60 degrees and watered freely as soon as growth starts. Cuttings may be made in two or three weeks. Forcing will generally be necessary from November to May - a succession being kept up by the introduction, at intervals of about three weeks, of an additional supply of roots, as forced roots soon decay. Often mint is so grown both upon and under the benches in greenhouses, and the demand for the young, tender stems and leaves during the winter is sufficient to make the plants pay well.
Mint Disease---Unfortunately, mint is susceptible to a disease which in some gardens has completely destroyed it. This disease, which from its characteristic symptoms is known as Rust, is incurable. The fungus (Puccinia Mentha) which causes it develops inside the plant, and therefore cannot be reached by any purgicide, and as it is perennial, it cannot be got rid of by cutting off the latter. All that can be done is to prevent the spread of the disease by digging up all plants that show any sign of rust. The same ground should not be used again for mint for several years. Healthy stock should be obtained and planted in uninfected soil, some distance away. On account of this liability of mint to rust, it is advisable not to have it all in one bed, but to have several beds of it, placed at some distance from each other
 Harvesting---When the plants are breaking into bloom, the stalks should be cut a few inches above the root, on a dry day, after the dew has disappeared, and before the hot sun has taken any oil from the leaves, and dried for culinary use for the winter. All discoloured and insect-eaten leaves should be removed and the stems tied loosely into bunches and hung to dry on strings in the usual manner directed for 'bunched' herbs. The bunches should be nearly equal in length and uniform in size to facilitate packing, if intended for sale, and placed when dry in airtight boxes to prevent re-absorption of moisture.
 The leaves may also be stripped from the stems as soon as thoroughly dry and rubbed through a fine sieve, so as to be freed from stalks as much as possible, or pounded in a mortar and thus powdered, stored in stoppered bottles or tins rendered airtight. If preparing for market and not for home use, the rubbed herbs will, of course, command a higher price than the bunched herbs, and should be put up in tins or bottles containing a quantity of uniform weight.
 When mint is grown commercially on a large scale, it has been estimated to yield from 4 to 5 tons per acre, from which 15 to 20 cwt. of dry should be obtained. Average yields per acre are, however, taken when crops are at maturity, and an estimate of the first cutting crop is hard to form, and is likely to be less profitable than succeeding years, on account of initial expenses.
 If Spearmint is being grown as a medicinal herb, for the sake of the volatile oil to be extracted from it, the shoots should be gathered in August, when just coming into flower, and taken to the distillery as soon as possible after picking, the British Pharmacopoeia directing that oil of Spearmint be distilled from the fresh, flowering plant. It is estimated that 350 lb. of Spearmint yield 1 lb. of oil. If the distillery is not on the ground or only a short distance away, and the crop has to be dispatched by train, the cutting should take place late in the afternoon on a fine day, before the dew falls, so as to be sent off by a night train to arrive at their destination next morning, having travelled in the cool, otherwise the leaves are apt to heat and ferment, losing colour.
 The chief constituent of Spearmint oil is Carvone. There are also present Phellandrene, Limonene and dihydrocarveol acetate. Esters of acetic, butyric and caproic or caprylic acids are also present. (An Ester is a combination of an alcohol with an acid, the combination being associated with the elimination of water. The esters are highly important and in many cases dominant constituents of numerous essential oils, which owe their perfume largely, or in some cases entirely, to the esters contained. Many of the esters are used as flavouring or perfumery agents, and many are among the most important constituents of volatile salts.)
 There are several different essential oils known under the name of Spearmint oil, the botanical origin of the plant used for distillation differing with the country in which the plant is grown. In the United States and in this country several varieties of M. viridis are distilled. In Russia the plant distilled is M. verticellata, and in Germany either M. longifolia, or more generally M. aquatica var. crispa - a plant cultivated in Northern Germany, the oil (called there Krausemünzöl) being imported into this country as German Spearmint oil. It appears to be identical with that from M. viridis. Oil of Spearmint is little distilled in England, either German oil or American oil distilled from M. viridis being imported.
 Medicinal Action and Uses---Spearmint is chiefly used for culinary purposes. The properties of Spearmint oil resemble those of Peppermint, being stimulant, carminative and antispasmodic, but its effects are less powerful, and it is less used than Peppermint, though it is better adapted for children's maladies. From 2 to 5 drops may be given on sugar, or from 1/2 to 1 teaspoonful of spirit of Spearmint, with 2 tablespoonful of water. Spearmint oil is added to many compounds on account of its carminative properties, and because its taste is pleasanter and less strong than Peppermint. A distilled water of Spearmint will relieve hiccough and flatulence as well as the giddiness of indigestion. For infantile trouble generally, the sweetened infusion is an excellent remedy, and is also a pleasant beverage in fevers, inflammatory diseases, etc. Make the infusion by pouring a pint of boiling water on an ounce of the dried herb; the strained-off liquid is taken in doses of a wine glass full or less. It is considered a specific in allaying nausea and vomiting and will relieve the pain of colic. A homoeopathic tincture prepared from the fresh plant in flower has been found serviceable in strangury, gravel, and as a local application in painful haemorrhoids. Its principal employment is for its febrifuge and diuretic virtues.
 Preparations and Dosages---Fluid extract, 1/4 to 1 drachm. Water, B.P. and U.S.P., 4 drachms. Spirit, U.S.P., 30 drops.
 When eaten with lamb, very finely chopped in sweetened vinegar, in the form of mint sauce, mint greatly aids the digestion, as it makes the crude, albuminous fibres of the immature meat more digestible. The volatile oil stimulates the digestive system and prevents septic changes within the intestines.
 The fresh sprigs of mint are used to flavour green peas and also new potatoes, being boiled with them, and the powdered, dried leaves are used with pea soup and also in seasonings. On the Continent, especially in Germany, the powdered, dried mint is often used at table for dusting upon pea and bean purées, as well as on gravies.
 A grating of mint is introduced sometimes into a potato salad, or into a fowl stuffing, and in Wales it is not unusual to boil mint with cabbage.
 Mint Jelly can be used instead of mint sauce, in the same manner as red currant jelly. It may be made by steeping mint leaves in apple jelly, or in one of the various kinds of commercial gelatine. The jelly should be a delicate shade of green. A handful of leaves should colour and flavour about half a pint of jelly. Strain the liquid through a jelly bag to remove all particles of mint before allowing to set.
 Mint Vinegar is made as follows: Fill a jar or bottle with young mint leaves picked from the stalks. Cover with cold vinegar and cork or cover the bottle. Infuse for 14 days, then strain off the vinegar.
 This vinegar is sometimes employed in making Mint Jelly, as follows:
 Take 1 pint of water, 1 1/4 OZ. gelatine, the white and shell of an egg, 1/2 gill of Mint Vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful of Tarragon Vinegar, a bunch of herbs, 1 onion, 1 carrot, a stick of celery, 10 peppercorns, salt, 1 lemon. Peel the lemon very thinly, slightly whip the white of egg, wash and crush the shell. Put all the ingredients into a pan, strain in the juice of the lemon and whisk over the fire until just on boiling point. Boil up, then draw the pan to the side of the fire and simmer very gently for 20 minutes. Strain through a jelly bag until clear. Put into a mould to set. If liked, finely chopped mint may be added to the jelly after straining it, or more mint can be used and no Tarragon Vinegar.
 To make Mint Punch: Pick a quart of fresh mint leaves, then wash and dry them by shaking them in a clean kitchen towel. Put them into a large jug and mash them with a wooden spoon till soft, when cover with freshly boiled water and infuse for ten minutes. Strain, cool, then set on ice till required. Add two cups of chilled grape juice and strained lemon juice to taste. Sweeten with castor sugar, stir till sugar is dissolved and then add a quart of ginger ale. Fill each tumbler to one-third with cracked ice and fill up with the punch.
 The Garden Mint is also the basis of Mint Julep and Mint-water, the cordial distilled from the plant.

McKinney’s Old (GNRI) Railway Bridge 
The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (GNR(I) or GNRI) was an Irish gauge (1,600 mm -5 ft 3 in) railway company in Ireland. It was formed in 1876 by a merger of the Irish North Western Railway (INW), Northern Railway of Ireland, and Ulster Railway. The governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland jointly nationalised the company in 1953, however the company was liquidated in 1958.
The Great Northern Railway (GNR) which ran from Omagh to L/Derry crossed the island of Islandmore (Corkan) via two metal railway bridges. The 'Red Bridge' which is located to the North of the island at Glenfad near Porthall and is still accessible but predominately used by the farming community and the river bed aggregate extraction company while the bridge onto Island More to the South was demolished by the British Army during the Northern Ireland 'Troubles' as where many small cross-border unapproved) roads. 
Known locally as 'McKinney's Bridge' it crosses the River Foyle which forms the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, hence the reason why the bridge was demolished and is now unusable as a crossing point. 

Anthony Marreco (26th August 1915 – 4th June 2006 aged 90) 
When growing up, I knew Islandmore or Corkan Island as 'Marreco's Island', named after Anthony Freire Marreco who was a British barrister and who had maintained a georgian house at Porthall, near Lifford, Co. Donegal, on the banks of the River Foyle overlooking the island.  

Anthony Blechynden Marreco was born in Leiston, Suffolk, England on 26th Aug 1915 where his father's regiment was stationed at the time, the only son of Geoffrey Freire Marreco 25th February 1882 – 15th September 1969) of The Old Court House, St Mawes, Cornwall and his wife, nee Hilda, Gwendoline Beaufoy Francis (15th December 1887 – 9th June 1967) from Hampshire. Both are buried at St. Lucadius Church of Ireland, Clonleigh Parish, Lifford, Co. Donegal, Ireland.

The Freire Marreco’s were of Portuguese origin; Antonio Joaquim Freire Marreco (1787-1850), Anthony's great-grandfather was born in Penafiel in Northern Portugal. Antonio established himself in business in England in the early 19th century and in 1834 married Anna “Annie” Laura Harrison (born in 1806) of Newcastle, the daughter of his English business partner William Harrison, at St Botulph's Church, Aldgate in London. He became a naturalised British subject. The Freire was the original Portuguese surname, Marreco was added by the grandfather after a trip to Brazil were at that time it was popular to add the names of flowers and bird, Marreco being a type of duck.  
Geoffrey, Anthony’s father  worked for Richard Garrett &amp; Sons a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, the factory was located in Leiston, Suffolk, England. 

Education
He initially attended a private school in Woking, Allen House before attending the Royal College of St Peters, Westminster from 1929 to 1934 where his lifelong interest in human rights began. His headmaster, Dr Crossley-White had invited leading personalities of the day to dinner. At the age of 17, Marreco met his childhood hero, T.E. Lawrence (1888 – 1935) and also Mahātmā Ghandi (1869 – 1948). 

Stage Career
In 1934 he joined the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), but was expelled after being spotted by the principal's wife at the Epsom Downs Derby, when he should have been attending classes. From 1935 to 1937, he began a career on the stage, playing in Shakespeare and forming friendships with figures such as Noel Coward and Johnny Weismuller. He joined Northampton Repertory and was stage manager at Crewe Repertory and later the London shows at His Majesty's, Daly's, the Arts Theatre and Royal Theatre. 

Military Career
In 1940 he joined Royal Navy as rating; Commission, Sub-Lieutenant (A) Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve R.N.V.R. and when the Admiralty learned that he had a pilot's licence, Certificate No:14851 issued by the Great Britain, Royal Aero Club Aviators at Airwork School of Flying, Heston Airport, Hounslow, Middlesex on 24 April 1937, taken on an Avro Club Cadet Gipsy Major 130. He was later commissioned to fly a Fairey Swordfish, a biplane torpedo bomber.
He received his wings on 6th October 1940 and was appointed to R.N.A.S. Arbroath in Scotland training observers.

In 1941 he was temporarily released from Naval duties on appointment as Assistant Counsel to legal department of Industrial Export Council and was later promoted to Lieutenant; appointed Royal Naval Air Service (R.N.A.S.) at Yeovilton in Somerset, Instructor, Fighter Direction School.

In January 1942 was appointed Fleet Fighter Direction Officer, Staff Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet, H.M.S. King George V (41) the flagship of the of both the British Home Fleet and Pacific Fleets which was involved in the hunt for and pursuit of the German battleship Bismarck. 
 
In April, Marreco was lent to US Carrier Wasp as Flight Deck Officer (FDO) to fly Spitfires off to Malta and in June 1942 was appointed to the Naval Night Fighter Development Unit.

In June 1943 he was appointed Flight Deck Officer (FDO) on an American built Attacker Escort Aircraft Carrier, which took part in “Operation Avalanche”, the codename for the Allied landings near the port of Salerno executed on 9 September 1943, part of the Allied invasion of Italy. 
In December 1943 he was appointed Flight Deck Officer (FDO) of the American built Aircraft Carrier, USS Pybus (CVE-34) rename by the Royal Navy, Emperor (D98).

In January 1944 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and appointed Flight Deck Officer (FDO) Aircraft Carrier Formidable, sailed to the Far East in September after being involved in the attack and sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz located in the Norwegian Alten Fjord. 
He was also engaged in the Battle of Okinawa, codenamed Operation Iceberg and later in June of 1945 he was discharged for passage to the UK to take up an appointment at the Admiralty as advisor on Kamikaze suicide fighters during the pending final assault on Japan. He left his ship in flew to Sydney, Australia and as Senior Naval Officer boarded an old P&amp;O liner call the Randi as which was carrying Japanese prisoners of war back to Southampton.  Marreco describes as part of his job aboard he had to get up at 5.00am and as he described it, “berry his brother and sisters who had not survived the night”.  

In 1946, Marreco was demobilised and return to civvy street, he soon accepted an offer to attend the Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal as part of the British delegation where he spent a number of months. 

During October 1946 he was appointed Chief Assistant to Deputy Chairman, Government Sub-Committee (Control Commission) for Berlin, Germany and later in April 1947 was appointed Director of the same.

In October 1947 was British member, Directorate of Internal Affairs and Communications; Chief Staff Officer to Political Adviser to Military Governor. 

During December 1948 he resigned from the Control Commission.

Legal Career
Having passed his first Bar Examination in 1938, he was called to the Bar (Inner Temple) in 1941 during his absence on war service.
He continued his law studies and took his Bar Finals at Twatt on a remote island in the Orkneys, invigilated by a chief petty officer. He was later a pupil of the distinguished Irish lawyer Brian McKenna in
Walter Monckton's chambers in the Temple located at 2, Paper Buildings, London.
He never returned to the Bar, and instead went on to become a human-rights advocate, helping co-found Amnesty International. 

Publishing
In the 1950s he was a director of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, established 1949, a British publisher of fiction and reference books. He also worked as an investment banker for SG Warburg &amp; Co founded in 1946 by Siegmund Warburg (1902 – 1982) and Henry Grunfeld (1904 – 1999).

Olympic Games – Germany 1936
Anthony received an invitation from Otto Christian von Bismarck (1987-1976) who was counsellor at the German Embassy in London (1929-1937) to attend the 1936 Summer Olympic games in Germany as part of an official party. On attendance with some others were, John Beverley Nichols (1898 – 1983) English author, playwright, journalist, composer, and public speaker and Mangal Heppeelipol (New Zealander) there was a mix up with their seats and it look like they would not get in, however a German SS officer frantically beckoned them upstairs to some fine seats. Minutes later Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels along with their respective wives arrived and took up seats directly in front. The party was in the charge of Ernst Hanfstaengl, nicknamed &quot;Putzi&quot; (1887 – 1975), who was a German-American businessman and became an intimate friend and confidant of Adolf Hitler who enjoyed listening to &quot;Putzi&quot; play the piano. Hitler was the godfather of Hanfstaengl's son Egon. Marreco witnessed the display of fury that Hitler showed when Jessie Owens won the 100 meters (Owens won four gold medals in the long jump, 200 meters, 4 × 100-meter relay and 100 meters). Marreco also remarked how Helene Bertha Amalie “Leni” Riefenstahl (1902 – 2003) who was a German film director, actress and Nazi sympathizer jumped up with her camera and filmed Hitler from every conceivable angle every time he spoke.  She was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million and directed the Nazi propaganda films “Triumph des Willens” (Triumph of the Will) and “Olympia” (video documentary of the games). The movies are widely considered two of the most effective, and technically innovative, propaganda films ever made. Adolf Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films during which they formed a friendly relationship. Some have argued that Riefenstahl's visions were essential to the carrying out the mission of the Holocaust?

Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal (1945 - 1949)
He takes up the story. &quot;I had returned from the Navy and I was back in my London chambers when one day in March 1946 after coming out of the dining hall of the Inner Temple, about three months into the trial, Hartley Shawcross, the Attorney-General fell into step beside me. He was a sailing acquaintance of my father and he said, 'Good to see you Marreco, how are getting on? “I’m fine”, and then he asked, 'Would you like to go to Nuremberg?' Marreco replied “Give me 24 hours”, he went back to his chambers and discussed the proposition with his colleagues who advised him to go. He arrived in Germany, just as Robert Jason was cross-examining Hermann Goering (18 March 1946) He was briefed by the head of the British team, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir.

Members of the British Prosecuting Counsel at Nuremberg included: Chief Prosecutor: Attorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross (1902 – 2003), Deputy Chief Prosecutor: Rt. Hon. Sir David Maxwell Fyfe (1900 – 1967), Leading Council: Mr. Geoffrey ('khaki') Dorling Roberts (1886 -1967), Junior Council: Major J. Harcourt Barrington (1907 - 1973, Major Frederick Elwyn Jones (1909 – 1989), Mr Edward George G Robey (1900 – 1983), Lieut Col. John Mervyn Griffith-Jones (1909 – 1979) &amp; Colonel Henry Josceline Phillimore (1910 – 1974). Mr. Airey Middleton Sheffield Neave (1916 – 1979), Sir Clement Raphael Freud (1924 – 2009) &amp; Peter John Ambrose Calvocoressi (1912 – 2010)

In all, six organisations, including the SS, the Gestapo and the high command of the German army were also accused. 199 defendants were tried, 161 were convicted and 37 were sentenced to death, including 12 of those tried by the International Military Tribunal (IMT). 

From March to Sept 1946 Marreco was Junior Counsel of the British Delegation his first task was to join a subsidiary tribunal to sort out the witnesses, convened under Airey Neave who was the first British officer to escape from Colditz Castle on 12 May 1942.The defence called more than 400 witnesses, and Marreco was present when they made their depositions and cross-examined them on behalf of the prosecution. He also describes how he helped draft the trials' forensic closing speech delivered by the head of the British team Sir Hartley Shawcross.

Marreco recalls, &quot;In the six months I was in Nuremberg, I got to know each of the Nazi defendants, and with one notable exception, I never liked any of them. Particularly, Joachim von Ribbentrop, the former ambassador to Britain who sat ashen-faced and was the most unpalatable character. Wilhelm Frick was a horrible little man, Walther Funk was another dirty little shit”. He loathed Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz whom he vividly remembered being &quot;brought into the courtroom clanking in chains&quot; and who paced up and down, giving the impression of a madman. But with Hermann Göring, Hitler's number two, there was something about his attitude and the way he took charge of all the defendants that was, for me, totally compelling.&quot; Göring, who sang-froid throughout the judicial process and on one occasion when a particularly attractive military wren was standing next to the dock, Göring reached out and pinched her bottom. &quot;She was so incensed and complained to the judge, but Göring knew he was going to die and he didn't care&quot;.
Britain’s legal team was tiny compared with the 300-plus American one, but Maxwell Fyfe told Marreco that the Americans had got bogged down because the German defence counsel had surprisingly called more than 400 witnesses, many of them SS guards who had previously been at the extermination camps of Auschwitz and Belsen.

The International Military Tribunal (IMT) announces its verdicts on November 1946. It imposes the death sentence on 12 defendants, Göring, Ribbentrop, Keitel, Kaltenbrunner, Rosenberg, Frank, Frick, Streicher, Sauckel, Jodl, Seyss¬-Inquart, and Bormann. 3 are sentenced to life imprisonment, Rudolf Hess, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder. The only one of them to serve their entire life in prison was Rudolf Hess. 4 receive prison terms ranging from 10 to 20 years, Doenitz, Schirach, Speer, and Neurath. The court acquits 3 defendants: Hjalmar Schacht (economics minister), Franz von Papen (German politician who played an important role in Hitler's appointment as chancellor), and Hans Fritzsche (head of press and radio).
The death sentences were carried out on 16 October 1946, with two exceptions: Göring committed suicide shortly before his scheduled execution, and Bormann remained missing. The other 10 defendants are hanged, their bodies cremated at Ostfriedhof, Munich, and the ashes deposited in the Iser River.

Post in Germany
As Chief Staff Officer to the Political Adviser to the British Military Government of Germany, and as British Member of the Directorate of International Affairs and Communications, Allied Control Authority, Berlin, from 1946 to 1949, Marreco was concerned with the creation of new institutions for law and democracy in Germany.

Political Career
Marreco contested Wells in Somerset as a Liberal candidate in the 1950 general election obtaining 9,771 votes however, he was unsuccessful being beaten by the Conservative representative Dennis Boles with 20,613 votes.  Again, in Goole in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the 1951 general election he obtaining 17,073 votes being beaten by the Labour representative George Jeger with 26,088 votes. 

Amnesty International
In 1960 Flora Solomon, his neighbour in Shepherd Street, told Marreco that her son, Peter Benenson (1921 – 2005) was founding the organisation which was later to become Amnesty International. Marreco, who had twice stood as a Liberal candidate for Parliament, supported him vigorously.

In 1968 he became Honorary Treasurer and had set up an Amnesty International Development Inc. (AID Inc.) in 1970 in the United States, which was totally separate from Amnesty International and which could send funds to families of Greek prisoners. This was strongly opposed by Amnesty International USA.
Outspoken in all his opinions, Marreco conducted several investigations for Amnesty, notably during the regime of the Greek Colonels, when he went to Athens to interview Stylianos Pattakos (1912 -2016), one of the junta leaders of 1967–1974, about allegations of torture and the curtailing of civil liberties. 

In 1971, Marreco investigated allegations of torture by British troops in Northern Ireland and subsequently resigned. Amnesty, he said, &quot;refused to go to Belfast and even see these people&quot;; he added that it was also a &quot;bizarre circumstance&quot; that Amnesty's chairman, Sean MacBride, was the leader of Clann na Poblachta  (Irish republican political party) from 1946 to 1965 and was a former Chief of Staff of  the IRA from 1936 to 1939. He also implied that he had received treats from the IRA when living at Porthall.
 
Mayfair Residents Association
For 13 years he was chairman of the Residents Association of Mayfair (RAM), steering it through turbulent times when it was opposed by the Association of Residents of Mayfair (ARM). When the two merged in 2004 he was appointed Honorary Present of the Residents’ Society of Mayfair and St James’s. He was also a member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and of the Garrick, the Royal Thames Yacht Club and the Beefsteak Club.  

Institute of International Criminal Law
In 1983 he proposed setting up an Institute of International Criminal Law, to be established in association with the Irish Universities. He offered Port Hall to the Irish government as a study centre, where &quot;the hideous violations of human rights, which had disfigured the 20th century&quot; could be researched. His ambition was to set up a television archive of the Nuremberg Trials to be used by lawyers and peace researchers from all over the world.
The Institute never came to fruition, possibly because Marreco also remained energetically committed to sorting out the legal and domestic problems of the Mayfair intelligentsia.

In his last years Marreco retired to Greenhill Bank Cottage, Aldbourne, in Wiltshire, with his wife, Gina, who was a brilliant hostess and an unforgettable cook.

Relationships
Anthony Marreco was married four times, but to only three women and had numerous affairs with other women but he had no children. 

Lady Ursula Isabel Manners (1916 - 2017)
Lady Ursula Isabel Manners was born 8th November 1916, being the elder daughter of five children of John Manners, 9th Duke of Rutland (1886-1940), by his wife the former Kathleen Tennant (1894 - 1989, aged 95). 
As a 20-year-old she acted as one of Queen Elizabeth's trainbearers in Westminster Abbey and received international media attention after a photograph of her from the coronation on 12 May 1937, standing alongside the British royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace which was  circulated in the news. The reports, focused on her beauty and distinctive widow's peak, leading to her being nicknamed &quot;the cygnet&quot; by Winston Churchill while she accompanied the king and queen on a royal tour in France in 1938.

On 25 July 1943, Lady Ursula married Anthony Marreco in the chapel at Belvoir Castle, Grantham, Leicestershire, a man she barely knew and who threatened to commit suicide if she refused to do so. The swiftness in which a wedding was organised prompted the minister to place a chair for her to sit on at the altar as he assumed, she was pregnant, this, she admitted, had infuriated her. 
 Marreco left her to serve in the British Armed Forces in Asia and lost communication with her until 1946. During this time she had entered a brief relationship with the Maharaja of Jaipur, Man Singh II, whom she met through her friend Jawaharlal Nehru. Lady Ursula and Marreco divorced in 1948.

She resumed her maiden name, and married secondly, 22 Nov, 1951, Robert Erland Nicolai d'Abo, scion of that landed family, elder son of Gerard Louis d'Abo, by whom she had issue, two sons and a daughter.

In 2014 she published her memoir titled “The Girl with the Widow's Peak: The Memoirs”.

Lady Ursula died on 2 November 2017, aged 100, she was one of the last surviving aristocrats to have participated at the Coronation of King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth on 12 May 1937.
 
Louise de Vilmorin (4 April 1902 - 26 December 1969)
Marreco also became involved with Louise de Vilmorin through the late 1940s until 1951 who was a French novelist, poet and journalist. Born in the family château at Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris, she was heir to a great French seed company fortune, that of Vilmorin.
She was afflicted with a slight limp the result of childhood Tuberculosis of the hip, however she compensated for her frailty with a flamboyant personality. She was a spellbinding talker who craved the limelight that she once flung a butterball to the ceiling when another guest at a dinner party wouldn’t allow her to tell a story.

De Vilmorin was never wholly sure of Marreco's devotion as in Venice, July 1950 her doubts were realised when Marreco went in successful pursuit of the somewhat unstable Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia, who fell madly in love with him and who then took an overdose after de Vilmorin removed him to Sélestat in France at the end of the holiday.

De Vilmorin's diaries are peppered with references to him. She was much taken by his style of dress - on one occasion a shirt with narrow blue and white stripes, a black silk tie with white spots, a black jacket and waistcoat, and spongebag trousers, black leather ankle boots. When he went out, he perched his bowler hat at a rakish angle, and carried a furled umbrella.
Above all, she was impressed by Marreco's Adonis-like looks, impressed that he could return from a fashionable ball at six in the morning, neither drunk nor tired, but invigorated with life, talking of beautiful women, fortune, society and success. &quot;Beauty likes to shine, to dazzle,&quot; wrote de Vilmorin, &quot;and above all to be recognised!&quot; She was deeply saddened when he left in the New Year of 1951 - conscious that she was 13 years his senior and that his career might place demands on him that would take him away from her. These concerns were replicated as Marreco at this time had political aspirations. 

Again, De Vilmorin's fears were realised while she was staying with Paul-Louis Weiller at his villa, La Reine Jeanne, with Marreco in tow. She awoke one morning and found him gone. He had set off to Brazil in pursuit of Lali Horstmann, whose book had recently been published to great acclaim. 

Vilmorin's first husband was an American real-estate heir, Henry Leigh Hunt (1886–1972), the only son of Leigh S. J. Hunt, a businessman who once owned much of Las Vegas, Nevada and his wife, Jessie Nobel. They married in 1925 (1924 according to other sources), moved to Las Vegas, and divorced in the 1930s. They had three daughters: Jessie, Alexandra, and Helena.
For a number of years, she was the mistress of Duff Cooper, British ambassador to France. Louise spent the last years of her life as the companion of the French Cultural Affairs Minister and author André Malraux, calling herself &quot;Marilyn Malraux&quot;. She died on 26 Dec 1969 aged 67 and is burial in  Verrières-le-Buisson (Essonne) cemetery also the initial resting place of André Malraux. 

Lali Horstmann (17 March 1898 - 10 August 1954) 
While serving in Germany, Marreco, then aged 36, became the lover of Lali Horstmann, who came from a distinguished German banking family, the von Schwabachs, her father was the banker and historian Paul von Schwabach (1867–1938). 
The widow of Alfred (Freddy) Horstmann (1979-1947) who was the head of the English department at the German Foreign Office, and an art collector. 

Freddy resigned in 1933, the year Hitler came to power, rather than work for the Nazis. He was taken away one spring night in 1946 by the Russian Secret Police, having refused to leave their estate in Kerzendorf, East of Berlin, on account of his fabulous collection of art and porcelain. 
Two and a half years later Lali learned, almost by chance, that Freddy had died of starvation in a Russian concentration camp only a few miles from their home.
Lali later wrote a moving account of her search for him, Nothing for Tears (1953), which has been described as &quot;one of the most remarkable personal documents to come out of Germany at the end of the war&quot;.
Their relationship ended in Berlin, but they remained friends, both in Berlin and later when Lali moved to London.

They met again in 1954 in Brazil only when Lali made her first trip to Brazil to meet friends who had settled in Paraná in the south of the country. Lali asked Anthony to drive her from Rio to Paraná; they stopped overnight in São Paulo, where Lali was found unconscious in her hotel room the following morning, having suffered a massive heart attack. She was rushed to hospital where she died the next day, aged 56. Lali Horstmann was buried in São Paulo.

Marreco inherited part of her substantial fortune, derived from her ownership of real estate in Berlin and her late husband's family interest in the Frankfurter General-Anzeiger. As a result of this Marreco bought Port Hall in Lifford, Co Donegal in 1956 where he lived and farmed until 1983 when he sold the house as his money was running out.

Loelia, Duchess of Westminster (6 February 1902 – 1 November 1993)
Marrero was subsequently the lover of Loelia Mary, Lady Lindsay of Dowhill, Duchess of Westminster was a British peeress, needlewoman and magazine editor.
Loelia was the only daughter of the courtier Sir Frederick Ponsonby, later 1st Baron Sysonby, and Victoria Lily (Kennard), Lady Sysonby, the well-known cook book author. Loelia spent her early years at St James's Palace, Park House at Sandringham and Birkhall. One of the Bright Young People, she met the twice divorced Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. They were married on 20 February 1930 in a blaze of publicity, with Winston Churchill as the best man, but were unable to have children. Her marriage to the enormously wealthy peer failed and was dissolved in 1947 after years of separation.

Loelia private diaries were likewise filled with anxious questions as to his love and loyalty. She encouraged Marrero to invest in Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, and for some years in the 1950s he was a financial supporter of George Weidenfeld. 

Regina de Souza Coelho (1927 - ?)
In 1954 Marreco went to Brazil for S G Warburg and while in brazil he met Regina (Gina) de Souza Coelho, only daughter of Dr. Roberto and Roberto de Souza Coelho of Rio de Janeiro.
He consummated his second marriage to Gina on 19th November 1955, but the marriage was dissolved in 1961. 
Anthony and Gina resumed their relationship in 1990, buying a cottage in Aldbourne, Wiltshire in 1997 and re-marrying in 2004. Very little is known about Regina (de Souza Coelho) Marreco. 

Anne Wignall (née Acland-Troyte) 1912 - 1982
Daughter of Major Herbert Acland-Troyte (1882 - 1943) and Marjorie Florence Pym (1891 - 1977). Anne born on 12 June 1912 in Kensington, London had been previously married to the 5th Lord Ebury, Rennie Hoare, and also Lt-Col Frederick Wignall.  

She firstly married, Robert Egerton Grosvenor (1914-1957), 5th Baron Ebury, son of Francis Egerton Grosvenor, 4th Baron Ebury and Mary Adela Glasson, on 1 July 1933. She and Robert Egerton Grosvenor, 5th Baron Ebury were divorced in 1941. A keen racing driver, Lord Ebury died in an accident at Prescott, Gloucestershire on 5 May 1957, aged 43, while driving a Jaguar C-type - XKC 046 (Registration MVC630).

Children
Francis Egerton Grosvenor, 8th Earl of Wilton, born 8 February 1934
2. Hon. Robert Victor Grosvenor, born 18 March 1936 and died 1993

Her 2nd marriage on 23 December 1941 was to, Henry Peregrine Rennie Hoare (1901-1981) son of Henry Hoare and Lady Geraldine Mariana Hervey. She and Henry Peregrine Rennie Hoare were divorced in 1947.
 
Her 3rd marriage on 13 November 1947 was to, Lt.-Col. Frederick Edwin Barton Wignall (b. 28 May 1906). He gained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in The Life Guards and died 9 November 1956.
 
Anthony marries for the 3rd time on 25 September 1961 Anne Acland-Troyte and as Anne Marreco she was the biographer of “Constance Markievicz - The Rebel Countess” (1967). Anne died on 23 June 1982 in Tiverton, Devon under the name of Wignall. 

Port Hall House
At Port Hall he bred a fine herd of Charolais cattle and was immediately accepted by that flamboyant section of Irish society known as &quot;the Donegal Group&quot;. Anthony was a convivial host, a considerable raconteur his hospitality was legendary being a generous host at Port Hall, with its spacious library and hand-painted wallpaper and at his summer house parties in Greece and in his book-lined flat in Shepherd Market in Mayfair in London. 
His guests ranged from Henry MacIlhenny (1910 – 1986), millionaire owner of Glenveagh Castle, Co. Donegal to historian R.B McDowell (1913 – 2011), who for 13 years (1956–1969) was dean of discipline at Trinity College, Dublin and once castigated future President Mary Robinson.

Port Hall house was owned by Anthony Marreco from 1956 until the 1983. He had a strong interest in building conservation and carefully repaired and conserved Port Hall during the 1960s. This important building is one of the most significant elements of the built heritage of Donegal, and forms the centrepiece of a group of related structures along with the warehouses to the rear, the walled garden to the south, and the other surviving elements to site.
Port Hall House was built in 1746 on the banks of the River Foyle, for Judge John Vaughan (1603 – 1674) also of Buncrana Castle, who served as a Grand Juror for County Donegal which was based at Lifford a short distance to the south-south-west of Port Hall. The design is attributed to Michael Priestley (? - 1777?), an architect who was also responsible for the designs of the Old Courthouse in Lifford’s Diamond (were John Half-Hung MacNaghten was held) and the Strabane Canal.
Marreco strenuously opposed salmon poaching, then running at a value of £1 million of fish a year. He became chairman of the Foyle Fisheries Commission (now known as the ‘Loughs Agency’) and immersed himself in every aspect of Ireland's cultural and political life.  
In the last year of his life, he had wished to make his own documentary, The Rule of Law, tracing the development of international law from the time of Grotius, the 17th century philosopher, to the present day.

Anthony Freire Marreco died on the 4th June 2006 aged 90 years and was buried in the graveyard of St. Michael's Church, Aldbourne, Wiltshire, England. Donations were requested for the RSPCA. 
A video interview with Anthony Marreco recalling moments from his life at aged 82 is available on YouTube.

Description: Die Orientalische Mauer- oder Mörtelwespe (Sceliphron curvatum), oder auch Asiatische Lehmtopfwespe gehört zu den Grabwespen. Die Art lebt normal nur in Nordindien, Nepal sowie in Kasachstan. Seit 1979 hat sie auch langsam Europa erobert. Im Jahr 2002 wurden auch die ersten Exemplare in Deutschland in in Nordrhein-Westfalen gefunden. Die Mauerwespe ernährt sich von Nektar, die Larven brauchen als Futter Spinnen. Diese werden von der Wespe gefangen, gelähmt und zu einem vorher gebauten Lehmtopf gebracht. Für einen Lehmtopf fängt sie etwa fünfzehn Spinnen. Ist der Topf ausreichend mit Spinnen gefüllt legt sie ein Ei und der Lehmtopf wird mit einem Deckel verschlossen. Die Larven schlüpfen drei bis fünf Stunden nach dem Auffüllen mit Beutespinnen und mindestens drei Stunden nach dem Verschließen der Brutzellen.

The Asian clay wasp (Sceliphron curvatum) belongs to the excavator wasp. The species usually lives only in northern India, Nepal and Kazakhstan. It has slowly conquered Europe since 1979. In 2002 the first specimens were found in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The wall wasp feeds on nectar, the larvae need spiders as feed. These are caught by the wasp, paralyzed and put in a previously built clay pot. It catches about eight to ten spiders for a clay pot. When the pot is sufficiently filled with spiders, she lays an egg and the clay pot is closed with a lid. The larvae hatch three to five hours after filling with prey and at least three hours after the brood cells close.

Description: Pellucid Hoverfly (Volucella pellucens) occurs in much of Europe, and across the Palearctic to Japan.

It is about 15–16 mm in length with a broad body. It is mainly black, but the front part of its abdomen has a broad, yellow band, giving it the appearance of a bee or wasp. The two wings are transparent, as with most flies, but the leading edge is amber, with a brown patch on each wing.

The mimicry of bees or wasps in shape, and colouration is shown by other hoverflies, and this is thought to protect against falling prey to birds and other insectivores which avoid eating true wasps because of their stings. However, the difference between hoverflies and wasps or bees is hoverflies have two wings, and the Hymenoptera species have four.

The adult V. pellucens is usually found in woodlands, but will enter gardens. It lives on nectar and pollen, as with most hoverflies, and visits flowers from May to October, showing a distinct preference for bramble. It typically flies at head height.

The female enters the underground paper nests of the common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, or the German wasp, Vespula germanica, and lays her eggs. Despite the conspicuous nature of the intruder, the hosts do not appear to register her presence as she makes her way into the otherwise well-guarded nest entrance. The V. pellucens larvae then feed on the hosts' young and dead adults.

When the eggs hatch, the larvae drop to the bottom of the nest chamber, where they feed as scavengers on debris. This may include dead wasp grubs and adults, remains of food brought into the nest by the wasps, and other insects living there. Mature larvae are sometimes on the combs and have been recorded feeding on dead or moribund wasp larvae and pupae which were left in the combs when the nest was abandoned by the wasps in the autumn. Fully grown larvae leave the nest and pupate in the soil below. If the host nest is in the roof or walls of a house, then it is not unusual for the larvae to end up crawling about in the dwelling space.

Adult hoverflies emerge the following year from about mid-May to June. Photo by Nick Dobbs, Bournemouth  25-06-20",2021-04-05 16:31:41

<b>Nysson is a sphecoid wasp that represents the origin of bees:</b>
Some ancient hymenopteran forms, that nowadays would be classified as part of the clade of Spheciformes, i.e. Sphecidae in the broad sense, are the sister clade to all Apiformes. 
However, James Michener notes: &quot;Bees arose from forms which, were they alive today, would be considered as Spheciformes ... I know of no synapomorphy of all sphecoid wasps that would justify regarding them as monophyletic sister group of the bees. &quot;

Larridae, Crabonidae and Nyssonidae are canditates for the sister-clade of Apiformes:

Description: A shot taken in late summer of 2019 presenting the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi. 
This colourful orb-weaver being a grasshopper specialist builds it's net mainly in relativily low growing vegetation, mostly 20-70cm above ground level. 
Out of three Argiope species ocurring in Europe it is the only one not bound to southerly climes, nonetheless being a thermophilic (warmth loving) species. 
During the 20th century the wasp spider managed to extend it's range in Central Europe following the changing climate from a couple of isolated populations in thermically favoured refuges (Kaiserstuhl hills, larger Berlin area) to - literally - being all over the map. 
In Germany for example they can now easily be found in every state and have established themselves as far north as Sweden and Norway.

Description: 50 years ago and now we are talking with the arrival on the 15th of June of NASA's Douglas DC-6 N428NA. In to calibrate the Winkfield Tracking Station, she parked North-side and If I recall correctly she was there for a couple of days
(Chris England caught her there the year before on the Southern parking:
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisengland/38178165555/in/photolist-Qq3k84-ejcZQt-21aF5vH-J9xRtU-CSkDVR-CSkDMK"">www.flickr.com/photos/chrisengland/38178165555/in/photoli...</a> )

Also in that day was Royal Canadian Air Force Boeing CC-137 (707) 13702 plus Seagram's Gulfstream II N777SW

The next day saw one of Lufthansa's Boeing 707's D-ABUL arrive as did Iberia's Fokker F-28 Fellowship EC-BVB and a bit of variety on the 17th there with an Aeroflot Ilyushin Il-62 86677 a highly polished RAF Transport Command Comet, XR395 and the star - Air Viking's Vickers Vanguard TF-AVA (see Markus Buttinger's lovely shot of her here: <a href=""https://imgproc.airliners.net/photos/airliners/0/7/4/0412470.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">imgproc.airliners.net/photos/airliners/0/7/4/0412470.jpg</a> )

On the 19th at Gatwick was French Air Force MS760 Paris No.40 along with Loftleidir's Canadair CL-44D TF-LLJ (Check out Michael Thorne's wonderful shot of her there just a month before: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/60580721@N06/8325207533/in/photolist-dFES9V-2d5knTG-X7TooT"">www.flickr.com/photos/60580721@N06/8325207533/in/photolis...</a> ) 

Back at work at Heathrow that day yielded a nice Lear Jet N77JN and a day later National Airlines Douglas DC-8 N108RD arrived along with some Eastern European items including Yugoslavian JAT's Douglas Dc-9 YU-AHP and Romanian Tarom's BAC-111 YR-BCB

Gulfstream I N671NC graced the tarmac there ass did Aer Lingus Boeing 707 EI-ASN (seen here in Bob Garrard's collection: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/23032926@N05/6432052299/in/photolist-x6FCv7-aNnX4r-iz7uwh"">www.flickr.com/photos/23032926@N05/6432052299/in/photolis...</a> )

Home on the 20th and seen overhead Worthing was Britannia's Boeing 737 G-AXNC. In those days most traffic used their registration as the use of Flight Numbers was mainly the preserve of the National Airlines  

Heading up via Gatwick the next day saw Capitol's Douglas DC-8-63CF N4909C (here's Nick Ellis 61's wonderfully evocative shot off her there: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickopix/28143227043/in/photolist-JSVsMZ-JSVoUt"">www.flickr.com/photos/nickopix/28143227043/in/photolist-J...</a> )
and overhead was MAC's C-141 Starlifter 66-0193. Again, thankfully fin numbers were 'king' back then for most airways MAC traffic radio call-signs whereas in these computerised days MAC's equivalent 'AMC' uses digitally allocated numbered 'Reach' call-signs that bear no relation to the airframe. 

However, my destination that day wasn't work but a day out at the then, annual Biggin Hill Air Fair.
As can be seen there were numerous gems there including Pacific Western's L-100 Hercules CF-PWN, a West German Luftwaffe Nord Noratlas 52+88 plus a selection of Royal Navy participants including Brawdy based Fairey Gannet AEW.3 XL450/BY764
(See peter Fosters fabulous photo here: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/40263244@N04/11584642793/in/photolist-2aUir9f-krm4Zf-iDGjGz-bYyw61-TETf73"">www.flickr.com/photos/40263244@N04/11584642793/in/photoli...</a> )
A relatively new Culdrose based Sea King XV661/CU96 and HMS Eagle based HS Buccaneer S.2 XV361/E106

Ted Smith Aerostar N7480S was there - a type based on the Aero Commander (here's a Belgian one passing the house a decade later: <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/29288836@N00/8125255701/in/photolist-do14rx"">www.flickr.com/photos/29288836@N00/8125255701/in/photolis...</a> )
and Hawker Hurricane G-AMAU aka PZ865 'the last Hurricane built' which was donated by Hawker Siddeley to what eventually became The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and still flies with them today 

RAF Hercules XV190 was there and on a similar note - and unidentified Belfast overflew on Airways on her way to Brize Norton

The Fleet Air Arm Flypast consisted of a couple of Sea Vixens, a Buccaneer and Phantom

Time away from work at Heathrow then followed as on the 23rd June 1970 I started my Royal Air Force awarded ATC Flying Scholarship
 
Shoreham School of Flying were nominated as my host as they had just won the right to teach such award winners and I just happened to be the first! So instead of being away at some far flung airfield, it was a simple mile long bike ride from my parent's house to the Airport and under the tutelage of Chief Instructor 'Doc' Watson, a quartet of Cessna F.150's, along with a pair of F.172's were at mine and two other fellow cadets disposal

For the next month I spent many a happy hour aloft with three different instructors - one being Doc but another was the inimitable and now sadly deceased Toon Ghose. A wonderful charismatic man and champion Glider pilot who, during the first week of our tenure was checked out by RAF Cranwell to be licenced to teach us Cadets. To celebrate his certification, on returning to Shoreham and much to the delight of all that had gathered to watch, he executed a perfect barrel-roll over the Flying School in a non-aerobatic Cessna 150!

Not much noted in my log for a week or so as it was ground schooling, flight planning and then flying!

On the 30th of June as a reward for our initial efforts, Doc Watson and us three Cadets piled into F.172 G-AXVX for a trip to their 'Cessna' approved maintenance company's base at Cranfield, up in Bedfordshire

This served as our first major 'Cross-Country' exercise and heading off from Shoreham we tracked around both the Gatwick and Heathrow Terminal zones before overflying RAF Halton where down below we spied an assortment of ex RAF airframes used for Instructional purposes. A trio of Vulcans, a Comet, a Twin Pioneer, a couple of Canberras and three Hunters slid by down below, then after eventually passing Leighton Buzzard we dropped into Cranfield.

While we waited for 'Doc' to sort out various business, amongst all the civilian light aircraft parked there, including my first Cessna 150 Aerobat N8308M, Cranfield's College of Aeronautics' MS.760 Paris G-APRU was noted along with a visiting Royal Navy Westland Wasp, XS453

Our return flight was the reverse routing but this time we were aboard G-AWGD, the school's other F.172 that we'd swapped for 'XVX'. We'd also swapped seats for the return and no doubt halfway back and being young then, without landing, we made a bit of a clamber about to swap again so that each of us got some useful flying time in

The Fairchild C-123 Provider is an American military transport aircraft designed by Chase Aircraft and then built by Fairchild Aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. In addition to its USAF service, which included later service with the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, it also went on to serve most notably with the U.S. Coast Guard and various air forces in Southeast Asia. During the War in Vietnam, the C-123 was used to deliver supplies, to evacuate the wounded, and also used to spray Agent Orange.

The C-123 Provider was designed originally as an assault glider aircraft for the United States Air Force (USAF) by Chase Aircraft as the XCG-20 (Chase designation MS-8 Avitruc)[1] Two powered variants of the XCG-20 were developed during the early 1950s, as the XC-123 and XC-123A. The only difference between the two was the type of engines used. The XC-123 used two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-23 air-cooled radial piston engines, while the XC-123A was fitted with four General Electric J47-GE-11 turbojets, in two pods.[2] The XC-123A also has the distinction, while only experimental, of being the USAF first jet-powered military transport.[3] While the piston-powered XC-123 was initially well-regarded for tactical transport for its ruggedness and reliability, and its ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips, the turbojet-powered XC-123A – designed for high-speed transport between USAF bases for critical parts and personnel – was found unable to operate from short and rough airstrips. There was also no practical speed advantage due to the wing and fuselage design, and a drastic reduction in range. Only the one turbojet-powered test and evaluation version was built.[citation needed]

By 1953, Henry J. Kaiser purchased a majority share in Chase Aircraft, feeling that after having completed C-119s for Fairchild under contract, he could take control of the impending C-123 contract. Two airframes were completed at Kaiser's Willow Run factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, before a pricing scandal that led to Kaiser's being told that no further contracts with him would be honored. The C-123 contract was put up for bid, and the two completed airframes scrapped. The contract was finally awarded to Fairchild Engine and Airplane, who assumed production of the former Chase C-123B, a refined version of the XC-123.[4] Before turning production over to Fairchild, Chase originally named their C-123B the AVITRUC but it never stuck.[5]
Operational history

The first recipients of C-123 aircraft were USAF transport units, soon followed by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) which used the aircraft for search and rescue (SAR) missions, and even the U.S. Air Force Demonstration Team, the &quot;Thunderbirds,&quot; used C-123s for a time as a logistics support aircraft for transporting the team's ground crews and equipment. The type would also be widely exported under various U.S. military assistance programs, directly from USAF stocks. A C-123 was used to transport President John F. Kennedy's limousine during his November, 1963, Texas tour.
USAF C-123Bs in the 1950s.

The C-123 was nearly ignored by the USAF for service in Vietnam, but a political rivalry with the U.S. Army and the Army's use of the CV-2 Caribou and later pre-production order for the de Havilland Canada C-8 Buffalo, led to a decision to deploy C-123s there. To compete with the well-performing CV-2, the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C-123 to allow it to do similar work on short runways. This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks, including the HC-123B which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971, and the C-123J which was fitted with retractable skis for operations in Greenland and Alaska on compacted snow runways.

By 1962, the C-123K variant aircraft was evaluated for operations in Southeast Asia and their stellar performance led the Air Force to upgrade 180 of the C-123B aircraft to the new C-123K standard, which featured auxiliary jet pods underneath the wings, and anti-skid brakes. In 1968, the aircraft helped resupply troops in Khe Sanh, Vietnam, during a three-month siege by North Vietnam.[1]

A number of C-123s were configured as VIP transports, including General William Westmoreland's White Whale. The C-123 also gained notoriety for its use in &quot;Operation Ranch Hand&quot; defoliation operations in Vietnam. Oddly enough, the USAF had officially chosen not to procure the VC-123C VIP transport, opting instead for the Convair VC-131D.

The first C-123s to reach South Vietnam were part of the USAF's Special Aerial Spray Flight, as part of Operation Ranch Hand tasked with defoliating the jungle in order to deny rebels their traditional hiding places.[6] These aircraft began their operations at the end of 1961. Aircraft fitted with spraying equipment were given the U prefix as a role modifier, with the most common types being the UC-123B and the UC-123K. Aircraft configured for this use were the last to see military service, in the control of outbreaks of insect-borne disease. The C-123 was also used as &quot;jump aircraft&quot; for U.S. Army Airborne students located at Lawson Army Airfield, Fort Benning, Georgia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This aircraft was used in conjunction with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed C-141 Starlifter.

In 1958, the U.S. Coast Guard received its first HC-123B, followed by seven more in 1961. Installation of a dome on the nose of the aircraft accommodated a large radar allowing the plane to meet the requirements for search and rescue and long range flight over water. The Coast Guard manned the aircraft with a crew of five: two officers serving as the pilot and copilot, augmented by an enlisted flight mechanic, an enlisted navigator, and an enlisted loadmaster. The HC-123B's role in the Coast Guard was slowly replaced by the longer-ranged Coast Guard HC-130 aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s as those newer airframes came on line.[7][unreliable source?]

With the end of the Vietnam War, remaining C-123Ks and UC-123Ks were transferred to tactical airlift units of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and the Air National Guard (ANG) that were operationally-gained by Tactical Air Command (TAC) before 1975 and Military Airlift Command (MAC) after 1975.[8]

The 302nd Tactical Airlift Wing at Rickenbacker AFB (later Rickenbacker ANGB), Ohio, flew the last UC-123Ks Providers in operational service before being converted to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Known as the Special Spray Flight, these aircraft were used to control insect-borne diseases, with missions to Alaska, South America, and Guam being among the humanitarian missions performed by this Air Force Reserve unit.[9]

The final examples of the C-123 in active U.S. military service were retired from the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard in the early 1980s. Some airframes were transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for test and evaluation programs while others were transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for miscellaneous programs. These aircraft were also retired by the end of the 1990s.

In 1954, the YC-123D, formerly the XC-123A prototype, flew in its modified state after being converted by Stroukoff Aircraft. While the most obvious change from the original XC-123A was the switch of engines (to two 3,500 hp (2,600 kW) Wright Turbo Compound R3350-89A radial engines, turning four-blade, thirteen foot Aeroproducts constant-speed fully feathering propellers), the YC-123D also had a boundary layer control system fitted. This system directs air from the engines at high speed over the top of the wing, making the wing act as if the aircraft is flying at a higher airspeed. As a result, the YC-123D had a greatly reduced takeoff and landing distance. Compared to the C-123B, the YC-123D could land in 755 feet instead of 1,200, and takeoff with only 850 ft of runway instead of 1,950, with a 50,000 lb total weight.

In 1955, Stroukoff, under contract from the USAF, produced a single YC-123E, designed to be able to take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff's Pantobase system, combining a ski system with a sealed fuselage and wing mounted floats, while retaining its normal landing gear. The skis worked both on snow and water, and the system effectively allowed the aircraft to land on water, land, snow or ice.

In 1956, the USAF awarded a contract to Fairchild to design an improved version of the C-123 under the designation C-136, but the contract was cancelled before the aircraft was built.[10]

At much the same time, the YC-123H was under development, the product of a Fairchild modification program started in 1956 and completed in 1957.[citation needed] A &quot;Jet Augmentation Program&quot; for existing C-123Bs had been initiated in 1955 at the behest of the USAF, and in the YC-123H contract the USAF expanded it to allow the mounting of two pod-mounted General Electric J85 turbojets.

In 1979, the Royal Thai government, seeking to extend the life of their C-123 fleet, placed a contract with the Mancro Aircraft Company, supported by the USAF, to convert a single C-123B to turboprop powerplants.[citation needed] Allison T56-A-7 turboprops were used and by the time the aircraft, dubbed C-123T, was complete it had new &quot;wet&quot; wings, an auxiliary power unit (APU) to assist with power movement of the control surfaces, and a heating system for the cargo compartments that also fed a new de-icing system.[citation needed] Budgetary restrictions forced the Thai government to abandon the program in 1981, and with a lack of interested parties development of the C-123T stopped.[citation needed] However, it concluded the life of the C-123 by making it the only aircraft type to operate under jet, piston, and turboprop engine power, and as a glider, during its history.[citation needed][N 1]

The C-123T has recently been revived by a joint venture between the US-based Fleetwings Aircraft Company and the South African company Elmer Group. In 2010, they announced a project to initially remanufacture old airframes for African customers and, where there was demand, to build new aircraft. The airframes would be fitted with new turboprop Rolls-Royce T56-A-15 engines, a glass cockpit and other enhancements. The proposed C-123T would have had a 25,000 lb payload capability, and a take-off run of just over 1,000 ft at 50,000 lb MTOW. Possible applications included maritime patrol, search and rescue, and even use as a gunship, while roll-on packages have already been developed for mid-air refueling and agricultural applications.[11]

During the Vietnam War, some C-123s were modified for specialized roles. Most of these modifications were on a one- or two-aircraft level. Only the usage of C-123s as &quot;flare ships&quot; to illuminate targets for fixed wing gunships such as the AC-47 and AC-119G were more numerous. These aircraft operating under the call-sign Candle were flown by the USAF's 14th Special Operations Wing.
US Air Force NC-123K &quot;permanent test&quot; model used over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. It was outfitted with a forward looking infrared system, low light level television, a laser rangefinder, and cluster bomb dispensers.

A single C-123B was tested as a possible replacement for the Candle aircraft, with its rear loading ramp removed and replaced with a large box with 28 large lights. The aircraft could continuously light a two-mile circle from an altitude of 12,000 ft. This aircraft, under the provisional designation NC-123B, was dropped because the lights fixed to the aircraft made it far easier for enemy gunners to track compared to the earlier flare ships.

The &quot;Candle&quot; aircraft had an extended life when several UC-123Ks were transferred to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand. During that period, it was used as a flare ship as well as a forward air control (FAC) aircraft. The flare duties were generally used for troops in contact (TIC) while the FAC mission directed air strikes in Laos over the Ho Chi Minh trail.

Another NC-123B was used as a radio relay aircraft over the Ho Chi Minh trail, with equipment to read the signals from various sensors on the ground designed to pick up enemy truck activity.

Two C-123K aircraft modified in September 1965 under Project Black Spot.[12] The Black Spot aircraft were to fit under the &quot;self-contained night attack capability&quot; that was Operation Shed Light's primary focus and E-Systems of Greenville, Texas, was contracted to complete the modifications. These aircraft featured a variety of new sensors including Low Light Level TV (LLLTV), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and a laser rangefinder.[13] The aircraft looked radically different visibly from its transport brethren, as the new equipment required lengthening the nose by over 50 inches.[14] The aircraft also featured an armament system designed to carry BLU-3/B (using the ADU-253/B adapter) or BLU-26/B (using the ADU-272/B adapter) bomblets, or CBU-68/B cluster bombs.[15][16]

The two aircraft, AF Serial Numbers 54-0691 and 54-0698, were first designated NC-123K in 1968 and then redesignated AC-123K in 1969.[N 2] These NC/AC-123Ks were first deployed operationally at Osan AB, South Korea, between August and October 1968, and flying in support of operations against North Korean infiltrators approaching by boat. The operations in Korea met with a certain level of success and as a result the NC/AC-123Ks were transferred to South Vietnam in November 1968. The aircraft operated there until January 1969, when they were redeployed to Ubon RTAB, Thailand. The two aircraft were then returned to the United States to Hurlburt Field, Florida, in May 1969, where a second round of training occurred. Four crews attended a ground school in Greenville, Texas, and returned to Hurlburt where they flew the aircraft for the first time.

The fate of the aircraft is still unclear. Sources have missions terminating in early July 1970 and the aircraft flying to the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center (MASDC) &quot;boneyard&quot; at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where they were returned to C-123K standard, then returned to South Vietnam still wearing their camouflage and black undersides for transport duty.[14] However, the official history states that combat operations ceased on 11 May 1969, with no mention of the second deployment.[12] While the second deployment is mentioned in associated documentation, the only dates are of the arrival in Thailand and there is no information as to when they departed or where their destination was.[17]

Covert operations
Southeast Asia

In 1962, the CIA acquired five C-123Bs from USAF for Air America to be used in Laos and Vietnam, and another 5 C-123Bs to be used by Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) top secret 34th Squadron, a Black Ops units called the &quot;Black Bat&quot;, as Flight B section (Flight A section was the two P2V-2U/RB-69A). The five Taiwan C-123Bs were sent to Lockheed Skunk Works for modifications as covert insertion aircraft with &quot;smart&quot; air-to-air jammer, BSTR system to jam the radars of ground anti-aircraft guns, also added a defensive operator's station to operate the jammers on board, with extra fuel in underwing tanks, with 36 Taiwanese crew finished training courses at Pope AFB by November 1962.

The five ROCAF/Taiwan/CIA C-123Bs would be used over North Vietnam as low level and nighttime covert airdrop aircraft, under the South Star II agreement, under the guise of Taiwan's national airline, China Airlines, which had &quot;cover story&quot; of operating Vietnamese Air Transport (VIAT) in South Vietnam, that was formerly operated by Air America. The secret outfit was based in Saigon, but would fly out of Da Nang for airdrop missions going into North Vietnam, with some missions lasting 14 hours.

On 1 February 1964, the overall control of South Star II was transferred from CIA to Studies and Observations Group (SOG), as part of U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) in Saigon. The outfit was redesignated as Det. 1 of USAF's 75th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS), but within SOG it was known as the First Flight Detachment (FFD).

In May 1964, under &quot;Project Duck Hook&quot;, six more C-123s received extensive modifications by Lockheed Air Service at Ontario, California, equipped with ATIR and BSTR ECM packages, ASN-25 Doppler navigation system, APN-153 terrain-following radar, a console station for radio operator, new HF radio and other radios. These aircraft were issued to the secret Taiwanese Black Bat unit operating in South Vietnam. In October 1964, MACV, CIA and ROCAF/Taiwan signed the South Star III agreement to continue the operation in Vietnam. The six &quot;Duck Hook&quot; C-123Bs were based at Nha Trang Air Base, north of Cam Ranh Bay, officially designated as USAF Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron.

The &quot;Duck Hook&quot; C-123Bs were updated with RDR-10 weather radar and ARN-131 homing receiver in 1966 in order to perform missions over the Ho Chi Minh trail. All C-123Bs were converted to C-123Ks in 1968, with two wing-mounted turbjets, plus an ECM upgrade with APR-25 radar warning receiver and ALE-1 chaff dispenser. Project &quot;Duck Hook&quot; designation was ultimately changed to &quot;Heavy Hook&quot;. The Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron unit at Nha Trang received an outstanding unit award from the USAF, for flying 4,000 classified combat and combat support missions from June 1966 to May 1968.

In May 1970, C-123Ks from the &quot;Black Bats&quot; supported the secret U.S. military incursion into Cambodia. In October 1970, flights into Laos began. In March 1972, the SOG was deactivated, and the Southern Star operation ended with four surviving C-123Ks returned to Taiwan. On 1 March 1973, 34th &quot;Black Bat&quot; Squadron of ROCAF/Taiwan was disbanded.[18]
Central America

On 5 October 1986, a Corporate Air Services C-123 Provider (HPF821, previously N4410F and USAF 54-679, (c/n 20128))[19] departed San Salvador-Ilopango Airport in El Salvador loaded with 70 AK-47 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, rocket grenades and other supplies. It flew along the coastline of Nicaragua and entered Nicaraguan airspace near the border with Costa Rica. Nearing San Carlos, the plane descended to 2,500 feet while preparing to drop off its cargo to Contra fighters.

While conducting the drop, the C-123 was shot down by a Sandinista soldier, using a SA-7 Grail. CIA pilots Wallace &quot;Buzz&quot; Sawyer and William Cooper were killed in the crash. Loadmaster Eugene Hasenfus parachuted to safety and was taken prisoner. He was later released in December 1986.[20] The Fairchild C-123 that was shot down in Nicaragua remains there. Its sister ship, also a Fairchild C-123 that was purchased by the CIA at the same time as the first one, was then left abandoned at San Jose International Airport for a time and then was purchased for $3,000 and disassembled into 7 pieces and transported via boat to Quepos, Costa Rica and then reassembled and is now the center piece of a beachside cocktail lounge just up the road from Manual Antonio national park.
Agent Orange controversy

In 2011, a retired Air Force officer, Major Wesley T. Carter, filed a complaint with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the Air Force Reserve at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.[citation needed]

The aircraft which were flown from 1972–1982, were assigned to the Air Force Reserve after their service in Vietnam, and used for normal cargo and aeromedical evacuation missions. Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with the windows open due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, &quot;...within official channels.&quot; Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the Robins AFB, Georgia Museum of Aviation with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting the scraps into ingots for disposal.[21]

On 9 June 2011, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force's Inspector General rejected Carter's complaints, and in a subsequent message explained, &quot;Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to identify or notify the individuals in the categories you mention&quot; when asked if the military would alert the aircrews regarding their exposure to dioxin. On 18 June 2011, the veterans' complaint was accepted with the Department of Defense Inspector General, adding the request that the UC-123K aircraft themselves be designated by the Secretary of Defense as &quot;Agent Orange Exposure Sites&quot;.[22]

In December 2011, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs posted two notices of its decision that, while the post-Vietnam aircraft &quot;may&quot; have been contaminated, the aircrews were &quot;unlikely&quot; to have suffered exposure to dioxin. In an unusual response, the U.S. Center for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry quickly countered the VA position on 25 January 2012 with a statement by their Deputy Director concluding that aircrews and maintenance personnel most likely were exposed well beyond military and government surface-wipe screening levels.[23]

In November 2011, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine began its own investigation into lingering C-123 contamination. In April 2012, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine released its review of the C-123 Agent Orange exposure issue and reported their researchers were unable to determine the degree of exposure, if any, which aircrews may have had aboard the contaminated aircraft in the period 1972–1982. Their report was, in turn, challenged by university-based experts Richard Clapp and Jeannie Stellman, both of whom continue to assert contaminated aircraft exposed the aircrews as well as aerial port and maintenance veterans. As of August 2012, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has denied service-connection (the linking of a veteran's illness to military service) to every application for medical benefits.

In September 2012, Thomas Murphy, Director of VA Compensation Services, wrote that TCDD (the well-known toxic component of Agent Orange) has not been shown to cause harm to humans in his denial of one veteran's application. On 25 November 2012, a committee of scientists and physicians, chaired by Jeanne Stellman, informed the VA Under Secretary for Benefits Allison Hickey that the VA's scientific conclusions regarding the C-123 situation were ill-founded and called on the VA to involve outside experts in a re-evaluation. In a subsequent telecon, Deputy Chief Consultant Dr. T. Walters informed veterans no C-123 exposure claims would be permitted to be approved, the VA forming a denial basis around redefining the word &quot;exposure&quot; to include bioavailability. No bioavailability equals no exposure, and thus no exposure claims permitted and indeed, since veterans began learning of the contamination of the C-123 fleet, no exposure claims have been approved other than via appeal to the VA Board of Correction.

Veterans have cited the 8 May 2001 Federal Register, page 23166, and the 31 August 2010 Federal Register, page 5320 5, each of which state:carried the VA statement: '&quot;Finally, we wish to make clear that the presumptions of service connection provided by this rule will apply to any veteran who was exposed during service to the herbicides used in Vietnam, even if exposure occurred outside of Vietnam. A veteran who is not presumed to have been exposed to herbicides, but who is shown by evidence to have been exposed, is eligible for the presumption of service connection for the diseases listed in § 3.309(e).&quot;

In August 2013, the Department of Veteran's Affairs approved the disability claim of Lt. Col. Paul Bailey. This is the first time the VA has recognized a crew member's claim related to Agent Orange exposure while flying planes after the Vietnam War.[24] The legal questions attracted significant attention from veterans' advocates, and the National Veterans Legal Services Project and the Yale Law School Veterans Legal Clinic published a comprehensive legal analysis. Exposure was confirmed as the single requirement upon veterans to prove for meeting Agent Orange disability claim requirements, and Yale Law detailed the exhaustive list of proofs establishing the veterans' exposure over the decade of post-Vietnam service of the former Agent Orange aircraft. Besides the legal analysis, Yale's purpose was that their finding be useful for all C-123 veterans in submitting disability claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In February 2014, a team of scientists headed by Dr. Jeanne Stellman and including Dr. Peter Lurker, Dr. Fred Berman and Dr. Richard Clapp published a pivotal scientific article in Environmental Research Titled Post Vietnam Military Herbicide Exposures in UC-123K Agent Orange Aircraft&quot;. The authors challenged both VA and USAF testing methods and earlier conclusions that the C-123K fleet was toxicologically harmless. Their research established that veterans had far greater, and more harmful, exposures than earlier estimated, and that the veterans' TCDD exposures exceeded any published safety standard. The authors noted:
Air Force Reserves flew about 34 dioxin-contaminated transport aircraft, 1971–1982.
VA denies benefits, claiming dioxin was bound in “non-available dried residue&quot;.
We used limited available sampling data and 3 methods to model dioxin exposure.
Estimated dermal–oral exposure exceeded US EPA standards for certain personnel.
Estimated airborne contamination exceeded the only available standard (Germany).

In response to developing scientific challenges to its position refusing C-123 veterans' exposure claims, on March 10, 2014 VA began revising their web pages to include reference to the submission of a special C-123 study project for the Institute of Medicine. First promised to the C-123 veterans in 2012, this study directs IOM to consider medical implications of their exposures. The results were published by the IOM on 9 January 2015, solidly confirming the post-Vietnam veterans' herbicide exposures, and faulting the 2012 USAF C-123 Consultative Letter which had relied on incorrect application of a formula in determining toxicity. Under Secretary Hickey assured veterans that VA would abide by the IOM findings, and VA immediately formed a committee to address its next step as C-123 veterans are brought into the VA health care system.

Notable appearances in media
Main article: Aircraft in fiction: C-123 Provider

A C-123K (54-709), N709RR (since destroyed in a crash in 2010) was prominently featured in the action film Con Air (1997); other C-123s appeared in Air America (1990), Outbreak (1995), Operation Dumbo Drop (1995) and American Made (2017), none of which were used in Operation Ranch Hand.[63][64] A C-123 was seen in the last episode of Season 5 of Nash Bridges where it was used by criminals and was shot down just after takeoff when Nash used a shoulder fired surface to air missile.

Description: The German wasp Vespula germanica is a social vespid native to Eurasia and Northern Africa that invaded NW Patagonia 30 years ago (Willink 1980). It has also invaded and become established in New Zealand, Tasmania, Australia, South Africa, the USA, Canada, and Chile. Each colony has numerous workers (non-reproductive females) which are responsible for food gathering and nest maintenance, and a few males (the drones) which are accountable for mating only. It is also known that V. germanica can tolerate low temperatures, which allows for the extension of daily and seasonal foraging activity patterns. Natural environments are uncertain and dynamic, and the food resources sought by V. germanica foragers, particularly carrion, may suddenly be removed by another predator. individuals with the behavioral plasticity to stop visiting a certain site which is no longer beneficial should have an adaptive advantage. in fact, it has been shown that vespids often return to sites where they have been successful.

Windfallen pears attracted many flies and some wasps. The Hornets took advantage of the sweet fruits for themselves and preyed on the wasps as nutrition for their larvae. I also  watched several failed attempts to catch flies.

The Hansa 2400 commenced production in 1952 as a large fastback saloon,, with simular styling to the US Hudson Wasp. The body was all steel of integral construction with forward opening doors. Sales material emphasied the carsd luxury fittings, such as heating and a vetilation system that could be adjusted to suit all passengers other items included cigarette lighter, the self-parking windshield wipers and the side windows that wound down fully into the doors ,
A year later a longer-wheelbase notchback limousine version appeared: options included a partition to enable the car to be used for traditional chauffeur operations. In 1955, production of the fastback saloon ceased. The long-wheelbase car underwent a minor facelift which involved more prominent headlamp surrounds. It was produced through to 1959.

#This car appears to have the later 2240cc S6 engine fitted in the 1959-61 Borgward P100
