Description: Amegilla cingulata

An important bee in Australia which is said to contribute very significantly towards pollination of crop plants as well as natives.

They are capable of stinging but are not aggressive to humans.

They are solitary insects which make their burrow in clay, sandstone or even the mortar in brickwork.

They are found throughout Australia except for Tasmania.  It is prey to a number of frogs, birds and the cane toad.  Its nests are parasited by the Neon Cuckoo Bee which has similar colouring to mimic its target species.

Description: December 23rd was a day of discovery for everyone at what we called our Christmas house.  I slept in after being up late the night before and up super early the last couple of days.  By the time I had gotten up everyone was excited with all the the beautiful wonderful things they were finding around our house.  The beach was amazing and so was the sunrise my wife tells me.  My oldest daughter had fun picking all kinds of tropical fruit from the many fruit trees on the 5 acre property.  My younger daughters had fun at the beach and watching the toucans and scarlet macaws that had already been visiting that morning.  And my son had already found 3 types of lizards in the yard, black spiny tailed iguanas, whiptails and some kind of anole and he was having fun chasing them around.  

I had volunteered to go to town on the super bumpy pothole dirt road to get our groceries for the next several days.  I also planned to meet a guy who was a retired naturalist and who had a ecotourism company but unfortunately I found out he was actually very sick.  Like alarmingly coughing sick.  It turned out he was a bad smoker and was having major lung issues and would not be able to guide me on a hike like I had hoped.  I did get some information on some other guides from him and did have a nice conversation with him about the wildlife of the area but was very sad about his health and disappointed that we wouldn't be able to go on a hike together.    

My daughter who was the main cook for our family on this trip had given me a very long grocery list in multiple text messages that was not in the order I would have put it in and which I had to spend a lot of time going through to find everything.  Not to mention the grocery stores there put things in strange places.  In hindsight I should have taken 5 minutes to cut and paste it into a proper notepad document and order it efficiently.   I literally spent 3 hours at the grocery store and mostly missed out on doing anything that day.  

By the time I was done with my errands in Puerto Jimenez it was already getting dark and starting to rain.  On the way back to the house I saw some of what looked like barn owls but I didn't have my camera with me.  I also saw some very large frogs hopping across the road and though of catching one for my son to see but focused instead on getting home so we could go explore.  

After unpacking the groceries and eating dinner the rain had started to subside a little and I was ready to get out and explore.  My wife and I had to convince my son that it would be more fun for us to go on a night hike than it would be to stay there and just chase the house geckos all over the house walls. We finally left the house much later than I would have hoped for.  

I decided to drive back to that river I hadn't wanted to cross the night before and hike a trail I saw that looked like it followed the river for a ways.
After we got there, got our gear on and started down the trail a truck drove up and stopped by our vehicle. We weren't too far down the trail so I went back to see what the person wanted or at least let them know I was watching them. The truck said Osa Conservation so I figured they must work for one of the local land trusts / ecolodges and decided to try and talk to him.  Unfortunately the guy only spoke spanish and I speak very little spanish so we couldn't communicate very well. I knew he was telling me that trail was private even though it was not marked private and I tried to ask him where we could hike and he seemed to indicate on the other side of the river I didn't want to cross in the dark. 

Back up the road there was a sign for a bird sanctuary that I had also thought of trying to do a night hike at so I drove back there and some dogs were out barking. The owner of the house came out and i asked him if this was the bird sanctuary pointing to the sign and he said in Spanish that no it was like 3km down the road. I really didn't want to cross that wide river in the dark so I decided to ask him if I could hike around on his property to look for snakes. He was a little surprised I wanted to look for snakes especially with my 6 year old son but was also very friendly and let me park on his property since its not a good idea to park on the roadside at night. I even tried to pay him for letting me park and hike there but he would not accept my money. He merely replied No, Mucho Gusto and Pura Vida. That man exemplified the best of the humans in Costa Rica. 

Unfortunately aside from a couple of little frogs that we had already seen on this trip and spiders we didn't find anything. I did find an interesting camera trap aimed at where something might cross a log over a stream. I wondered if that trap sometimes caught Jaguars or cougars crossing there. After that hike I thought of maybe stopping at the place we had gone the night before but for some reason didn't feel like it and we just drove back to our rental. When we got back I decided we should look around the 5 acres of fruit trees and flowering trees on the rental property to see what we could see. Unfortunately we only found a cane toad and this cute treefrog right outside the house. We explored farther into the yard but didn't find anything else.

I somehow only took like 10 photos that whole day and had to go back through my cameras memory cards twice just to verify I didn't somehow lose any.  Its sad that I don't remember a lot about that day. But the highlight was definitely meeting that nice Costa Rican living in the jungle with his dogs who wouldn't even accept any money from me and was happy to let us explore his property in  the dark.",2021-04-14 09:48:37

Description: The UN SDG that comes to mind here is #15: Life on land, which aims to “Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation,  [and] halt biodiversity loss” (UN SDG site). Pictured here is a white mulberry tree (Morus alba) that has gradually become covered with English ivy (Hedera helix) over many years. While the tree and ivy are in my neighbor’s yard, an abundance of mulberries never fails to blanket the ground each spring. The problem lies in the nature of both plants, which are considered highly invasive within the state of Maryland (maipc.org) The ecological damage that invasive species bring to introduced areas includes: displacement of native species via competition, which leads to alterations throughout an ecosystem. Loss of native species affects organisms that rely on these species and has the potential to alter the biodiversity of a region as native species migrate to new regions, die off, or adapt to these new conditions. 
Sustainable management of forests relies on an understanding of: the organisms that inhabit a region, the interspecific and intraspecific interactions that occur, and contextual adjustments between an  individual, population, or community viewpoint. In the case of the invasive plants above, it is clear that the English ivy is eventually going to choke out the mulberry tree, providing a possible solution to one invasive species. However, the amount of time needed for this to occur is unclear, how many more springs will the tree survive and spread its seeds before succumbing to the ivy? Also, the ivy itself only spreads its seeds after it reaches a certain height, meaning that both species are actively spreading seed and possibly disrupting other native areas. While my backyard is not a forest, I think the intertwining invasives provides an ideal example of the complexities that would be involved in sustainable forest management. For example, some native plant species may be driven away by invasives, but sudden removal of newly established invasive plants may harm organisms that have adjusted to rely on these new plants. Other than that, English ivy is incredibly difficult to control or eradicate once it is established, so what other solutions could be applied here? The answer can vary from region to region, but the central theme is a solution that minimizes costs while maximizing benefits. If we want to sustainably manage forests and other green spaces for future populations to enjoy we need to understand the intricacies present within these environments that may be altered by short-sighted solutions. This is vital to avoid ecological disasters such as Cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in Madagascar, or kudzu (Puereria montana) in the United States

Description: Chestnuts roasting on an open fire…This lovely holiday tune was written in 1945, a time when you could still find a few American chestnut trees and the fall harvest of the tasty nuts were available to give rise to festivals and inspire songs and literary references.  However, when we brought Japanese chestnut trees here around the turn of the last century, we accidentally brought a little hitchhiker here as well, a pathogenic fungus that would, in less than 50 years, wipe out pretty much every single American chestnut on the continent, about four billion trees.  This is an excellent example of how the very human desire to have it all has often causes havoc in our natural ecosystems.   Now, we have Japanese honeysuckle, kudzu, Asian bittersweet, zebra mussels, marmorated stinkbugs, emerald ash borer and cane toads to deal with, causing untold millions of dollars to be spent on control of these species that arrive here with no diseases, predators or other natural controls.  We’ve thankfully learned a lot since those days, but must be constantly vigilant about bringing species to new locations where they could quickly become a serious problem.

Chinese chestnut trees have been exposed to the chestnut blight fungus for a very long time and thus have been able to evolve defenses against it so they thrive here in the United States. Scientists are working on a hybrid of Chinese chestnut and American chestnut trees that can withstand the blight and integrate into our forest ecosystems, providing all the resources our wildlife used to enjoy. These three lovely Hood campus trees have been producing a bountiful harvest for many years to the delight of the local wildlife--fat squirrels that can be seen eating and hiding the plump, shiny nuts in September.  First, they have to wait until the spiny husk splits open and drops the seeds because that husk is just rude.  In-the-know humans can share in this bounty, too.  Just score the nuts and pop them into the oven or, roast in a pie pan over an open fire.  Make sure you sing when you do, to get the full experience!

OVERVIEW
Corvus is a widely distributed genus of medium-sized to large birds in the family Corvidae. The genus includes species commonly known as crows, ravens and rooks; there is no consistent distinction between &quot;crows&quot; and &quot;ravens&quot;, and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens.

The 45 or so members of this genus occur on all temperate continents except South America, and several islands. The crow genus makes up a third of the species in the family Corvidae. The members appear to have evolved in Asia from the corvid stock, which had evolved in Australia. The collective name for a group of crows is a &quot;flock&quot; or a &quot;murder&quot;. The genus name is Latin for &quot;raven&quot;.

Recent research has found some crow species capable of not only tool use, but also tool construction. Crows are now considered to be among the world's most intelligent animals with an encephalization quotient equal to that of many non-human primates.

Description
Medium-large species are ascribed to the genus, ranging from 34 cm of some small Mexican species to 60–70 cm of the large common raven and thick-billed raven, which together with the lyrebird represent the larger passerines.

These are birds with a robust and slender appearance, equipped with a small rounded head with a strong conical beak, elongated and pointed, with a slightly curved end towards the bottom: the legs are strong and the tail is short and wedge-shaped .

The coloration of the livery is dominated by shades of black, with some species having plumage with metallic iridescences and others that have white or grey areas on the neck or torso: Australian species have light eyes, while generally the irises are dark.

Evolutionary history and systematics
The members of the genus Corvus are believed to have evolved in Central Asia and radiated out from there into North America, Africa, Europe, and Australia.

The latest evidence regarding the evolution indicates descent within the Australasian family Corvidae. However, the branch that would produce the modern groups such as jays, magpies, and large, predominantly black Corvus species had left Australasia and were concentrated in Asia by the time the Corvus species evolved.

The genus was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. The name is derived from the Latin corvus meaning &quot;raven&quot;.

The type species is the common raven (Corvus corax); others named in the same work include the carrion crow (C. corone), the hooded crow (C. cornix), the rook (C. frugilegus), and two species which have since been moved to other genera, the western jackdaw (now Coloeus monedula) and the Eurasian magpie (now Pica pica). At least 42 extant species are now considered to be members of Corvus, and at least 14 extinct species have been described.

The fossil record of crows is rather dense in Europe, but the relationships among most prehistoric species are not clear. Corvids are found in major cities across the world, and a major increase in the number of crows in urban settings has occurred since the 1900s. Historical records suggest that the population of American crows found in North America has been growing steadily since the introduction of European colonization, and spread east to west with the opening of the frontier. Crows were uncommon in the Pacific Northwest in the 1900s, except in riparian habitats. Populations in the west increased substantially from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. Crows and ravens spread along with agriculture and urbanization into the western part of North America.

Behaviour
Crows gather in large communal roosts numbering between 200 and tens of thousands of individuals during nonbreeding months, particularly in the winter. These gatherings tend to happen near large food sources such as garbage dumps and shopping centres. 

Play
Countless incidents are recorded of corvids at play. Many behaviourists see play as an essential quality in intelligent animals.

Calls
Crows and the other members of the genus make a wide variety of calls or vocalisations. Crows have also been observed to respond to calls of other species; presumably, this behaviour is learned because it varies regionally. Crows' vocalizations are complex and poorly understood. Some of the many vocalizations that crows make are a &quot;koww&quot;, usually echoed back and forth between birds, a series of &quot;kowws&quot; in discrete units, a long caw followed by a series of short caws (usually made when a bird takes off from a perch), an echo-like &quot;eh-aw&quot; sound, and more. These vocalisations vary by species, and within each species they vary regionally. In many species, the pattern and number of the numerous vocalizations have been observed to change in response to events in the surroundings (e.g. arrival or departure of crows).

Intelligence
As a group, crows show remarkable examples of intelligence. Natural history books from the 18th century recount an often-repeated, but unproven anecdote of &quot;counting crows&quot; — specifically a crow whose ability to count to five (or four in some versions) is established through a logic trap set by a farmer. Crows and ravens often score very highly on intelligence tests. Certain species top the avian IQ scale. Wild hooded crows in Israel have learned to use bread crumbs for bait-fishing. Crows engage in a kind of mid-air jousting, or air-&quot;chicken&quot; to establish pecking order. They have been found to engage in activities such as sports, tool use, the ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic-like memory, and the ability to use individual experience in predicting the behaviour of proximal conspecifics.

One species, the New Caledonian crow, has also been intensively studied recently because of its ability to manufacture and use tools in the day-to-day search for food. On 5 October 2007, researchers from the University of Oxford presented data acquired by mounting tiny video cameras on the tails of New Caledonian crows. They pluck, smooth, and bend twigs and grass stems to procure a variety of foodstuffs. Crows in Queensland have learned how to eat the toxic cane toad by flipping the cane toad on its back and violently stabbing the throat where the skin is thinner, allowing the crow to access the nontoxic innards; their long beaks ensure that all of the innards can be removed.

The western jackdaw and the Eurasian magpie have been found to have a nidopallium about the same relative size as the functionally equivalent neocortex in chimpanzees and humans, and significantly larger than is found in the gibbons.

Crows have demonstrated the ability to distinguish individual humans by recognizing facial features. Evidence also suggests they are one of the few nonhuman animals, along with insects like bees or ants, capable of displacement (communication about things that are not immediately present, spatially or temporally). Ravens have been observed to recruit other ravens to large feeding sites, such as to the carcass of an animal.

A postally unused postcard published in 1967 by Y. de Lima &amp; Co. Ltd. of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, W.I. The card was printed in the USA by Dexter Press Inc. of West Nyack, New York.

On the divided back of the card the publishers state:

The World's Greatest Show'.

<u>Trinidad</u>

Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the two islands of Trinidad and Tobago. The island lies 11 km (6.8 mi) off the north-eastern coast of Venezuela, and sits on the continental shelf of South America. 

It is often referred to as the southernmost island in the Caribbean. With an area of 5,131 km2 (1,981 sq mi), it is also the fifth largest in the West Indies.

<u>Trinidad's Name</u>

Caribs and Arawaks lived in Trinidad long before Christopher Columbus encountered the islands during his third voyage on the 31st. July 1498. 

The original name for the island in the Arawaks' language was Iëre which meant 'Land of the Hummingbird'. Christopher Columbus re-named it La Isla de la Trinidad ('The Island of the Trinity'), fulfilling a vow he had made before setting out on his third voyage. This has since been shortened to Trinidad.

<u>History of Trinidad</u>

The island remained Spanish until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists from the French Caribbean, especially Martinique. In 1889 the two islands became a single British Crown colony. Trinidad and Tobago obtained self-governance in 1958, and independence from the United Kingdom in 1962.

<u>Geography of Trinidad</u>

Major landforms include the hills of the Northern, Central and Southern Ranges (Dinah ranges), the Caroni, Nariva and Oropouche Swamps, and the Caroni and Naparima Plains. 

Major river systems include the Caroni, North and South Oropouche and Ortoire Rivers. There are many other natural landforms such as beaches and waterfalls. 

Trinidad has two seasons per the calendar year: the rainy season and the dry season.

<u>Trinidad's Culture</u>

There are multiple festivals featuring the music of the Caribbean and the steelpan, which originated in Trinidad and is the country's national instrument. 

These festivals include the world-renowned Carnival, J'Ouvert, and Panorama, the national steel pan competition. 

Trinidad also has many public holidays, such as Indian Arrival Day, Emancipation Day, Independence Day, Republic Day, Labour Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Day, Diwali, Phagwa, Eid al-Fitr, Corpus Christi, Good Friday, Easter, Easter Monday, Christmas, and Spiritual Baptist/Shouter Liberation Day. 

Places of cultural significance include Mount Saint Benedict and the Temple in the Sea.

<u>Zoology of Trinidad</u>

The island of Trinidad has a rich biodiversity. The fauna is overwhelmingly of South American origin. There are about 100 species of mammals including the Guyanese red howler monkey, the collared peccary, the red brocket deer, the ocelot and about 70 species of bats. 

There are over 400 species of birds including the endemic Trinidad piping-guan. Reptiles are well represented, with about 92 recorded species, including the largest species of snake in the world, the green anaconda, the spectacled caiman, and one of the largest lizards in the Americas, the green iguana. 

The largest of turtles (the leatherback turtle) nests on Trinidad's eastern and northern beaches. There are 37 recorded frog species, including the tiny El Tucuche golden tree frog, and the more widespread huge cane toad. 

About 43 species of freshwater fish are known in Trinidad, including the well known guppy. It is estimated that there are at least 80,000 arthropods, and at least 600 species of butterfly. Arthropods include centipedes, insects, spiders and crustaceans.",2021-04-14 09:48:57

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amegilla_cingulata"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amegilla_cingulata</a>

Amegilla cingulata, commonly known as the blue-banded bee, is an Australian native bee that occurs in many other regions. Currently, several scientific organizations are conducting research on how the blue-banded bee benefits agriculture through its distinctive &quot;buzz pollination&quot;. These bees are very important for the production of food and contribute to at least 30% of crops in Australia.

A. cingulata builds a solitary nest, but often close to other conspecifics. Blue-banded bees tend to nest in burrows in dried-up river banks, old clay homes, and mortar between bricks, but may also burrow in soft sandstone, and areas of this type of rock can become riddled with bee tunnels.Cells, at the end of tunnels, contain an egg with a pollen/nectar mixture for the larval food.A. cingulata is preyed upon by many animals, including the cane toad, frogs, and birds. Its nests are parasitized by the neon cuckoo bee Thyreus nitidulus.[2] Human activity, for example the clearing of river banks in the Caboolture River, may threaten nest sites of this bee.",2021-04-14 09:48:57

Description: Cane toads (Bufo marinus) were brought to Australia from Hawaii with the intention to control the cane beetle in sugar cane fields in north Queensland. Only 102 cane toads were brought over to be bred, and 2,400 toads were released in 1935.
 Since their release, toads have rapidly multiplied in population and now number over 200 million and have been known to spread diseases affecting local biodiversity. Unfortunately, the introduction of the toads has not only caused large environmental detriment, but there is no evidence that they have affected the cane beetles that they were introduced to prey upon. The toads have steadily expanded their range through Queensland, reaching the border with New South Wales in 1978 and the Northern Territory in 1984. The toads on the western frontier of their advance have evolved larger legs; this is thought to be related to their ability to travel farther. As a consequence of their longer legs, larger bodies, and faster movement, about 10% of the leading edge cane toads have also developed arthritis!
Cane toads are capable of poisoning predators that try to eat them and they continue to spread across Australia. There is no broadscale way to control this pest but scientists are developing a better understanding of the impacts they have on the environment and the ways in which assets, such as rare and vulnerable wildlife, can be protected.&quot;",2021-04-14 09:49:08

Pride of place here is taken by the prickly pear which in 1920 covered around 240000 square km's of Australia. In 1926 they introduced a small moth from Argentina which by 1932 had practically wiped it out. Unfortunately they were so inspired with this success that when cane beetles were reducing the sugar cane yield in 1935 someone came up with the great idea of releasing cane toads.

Description: Sleeping beauty 

One evening last week I went into our backyard. It was dark so I took a torch with me as I was curious to see what animals I would spot. There was not much out there apart from mozzies, moths and the odd Cane Toad.

I walked along our hedge and spotted sleeping native Blue Banded Bees. I found 5 of them all hanging tightly grabbing with their mandibles on a twig. I was over the moon when I found them. I have seen the occasional blue-banded bee flying in the same spot during the afternoon but haven’t seen them sleeping there. During the daytime, it is very hard to capture the bee as they are very fast and erratic flyer.

I grabbed my light stand and mounted my LED Lenser torch onto it and set up my camera on a tripod with my macro gear attached. As the bee stayed in the same position I was able to photograph it as it was sleep-hanging on the twig. 

Description:
Amegilla cingulata, commonly known as the blue-banded bee, is an Australian native bee that occurs in many other regions. Currently, several scientific organisations are researching how the blue-banded bee benefits agriculture through its distinctive &quot;buzz pollination&quot;. These bees are very important for the production of food and contribute to at least 30% of crops in Australia. (Text Source: Wikipedia)

I have a small blog all about Wildlife photography and photography related topics. Interested in my latest blog, Social Media Pressure? <a href=""https://www.spohr-photography.com/blog/2020/3/social-media-pressure"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.spohr-photography.com/blog/2020/3/social-media-pressure</a>

My passion is wildlife photography and I hope I can bring the beauty of nature into your home and show how amazing nature is. Every single animal needs our protection as they all play an important part in our survival.

There is an abundance of scientific reports telling us that the rate of extinction is happening at an alarming rate. More and more fauna and flora are going to disappear. With my wildlife photography, I hope to showcase a fraction of animals before they are gone. Only what you know, you will love and protect…

A bit of further reading below from Wikipedia for those interested.
Description: The eastern brown snake appears to hunt by sight more than other snakes, and a foraging snake raises its head like a periscope every so often to survey the landscape for prey.[40] It generally finds its food sources in their refuges rather than chasing fleeing prey.[48] The adult is generally diurnal, while juveniles sometimes hunt at night.[49] The eastern brown snake rarely eats during winter, and females rarely eat while pregnant with eggs.[50] The eastern brown snake has been observed coiling around and constricting prey to immobilise and subdue it,[51] adopting a strategy of poisoning and grappling their prey.[48] Herpetologists Richard Shine and Terry Schwaner proposed that it might be resorting to constriction when attacking skinks as it might facilitate piercing the skink's thick scales with its small fangs.[52]

The eastern brown snake's diet is made up almost wholly of vertebrates, with mammals predominating—particularly the introduced house mouse. Mammals as large as feral rabbits have been eaten. Small birds, eggs, and even other snakes are also consumed.[49] Snakes in areas of natural vegetation or paddocks for stock eat a higher proportion of reptiles, while those in crop fields eat more mice.[49] Small lizards such as skinks are more commonly eaten than frogs, as eastern brown snakes generally forage in areas over 100 m (350 ft) distant from water.[53] Snakes larger than 7 cm (2.8 in) from snout to vent eat predominantly warm-blooded prey, while smaller snakes mainly eat ectothermic animals.[25] Other snakes, such as the common death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus),[54] and carpet python (Morelia spilota), have also been eaten.[55] Cannibalism has also been recorded in young snakes.[55] The bearded dragon is possibly resistant to the effects of the venom.[25] Although the eastern brown snake is susceptible to cane toad toxins, young individuals avoid eating them, which suggests they have learnt to avoid them.[56] Some evidence indicates they are immune to their own venom and that of the mulga snake (Pseudechis australis), a potential predator.[25]

Venom
The eastern brown snake is considered the second-most venomous terrestrial snake in the world, behind only the inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) of central east Australia.[57] Responsible for more deaths from snakebite in Australia than any other species,[58] it is the most commonly encountered dangerous snake in Adelaide, and is also found in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, and Brisbane.[35] As a genus, brown snakes were responsible for 41% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, and for 15 of the 19 deaths during this period.[59] Within the genus, the eastern brown snake is the species most commonly implicated.[55] It is classified as a snake of medical importance by the World Health Organization.[60][c]


Dangerous snake poster published by Museum Victoria in 1877
Clinically, the venom of the eastern brown snake causes venom-induced consumption coagulopathy; a third of cases develop serious systemic envenoming including hypotension and collapse, thrombotic microangiopathy, severe haemorrhage, and cardiac arrest.[61] Other common systemic symptoms include nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis (sweating), and abdominal pain. Acute kidney injury and seizures can also occur.[61] Onset of symptoms can be rapid, with a headache developing in 15 minutes and clotting abnormalities within 30 minutes;[58] collapse has been recorded as occurring as little as two minutes after being bitten.[61] Death is due to cardiovascular causes such as cardiac arrest or intracranial haemorrhage.[61] Often, little local reaction occurs at the site of the bite. The classical appearance is of two fangmarks around 1 cm apart.[62] Neurotoxicity is rare and generally mild, and myotoxicity (rhabdomyolysis) has not been reported.[61][63]",2021-04-14 09:49:24

Description: Common tree snake Dendrelaphis punctulata.
The common tree snake is highly variable in colour and is also known as green tree snake. The body is extremely slender and can be either grey, olive-green, various shades of brown, black, even blue and turquoise. It can inflate its body to show patches of bright blue skin between the body scales when disturbed. The underside is usually cream or yellow or light blue in some individuals. Common tree snakes are found in a variety of habitat types, but are usually seen in eucalypt woodland or rainforest areas. They are active during the day in trees and on the ground, feeding mostly on frogs and birds. They are non-venemous and grow to an average of 1.5m. This seemed to be a particularly thin individual. Maybe I need to give it a good feed. I wish it would eat cane toads, aphids, and ants.",2021-04-14 09:49:41

Description: Mistakenly called the Fijian Ground Frog by most locals. The cane toad was introduced into Fiji to combat insects that infested sugarcane plantations. After considering the possible side effects, the national government of Fiji decided to release the toad in 1953, and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from Hawaii.Once the toads were established, a 1963 study concluded, as the toad's diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates, it was considered &quot;economically neutral&quot;. Today, the cane toad can be found on all major islands in Fiji, although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions

Description: Also known as the Australian native Water Rat.

These large, cute rodents are native to Australia and have learnt how to eat Cane Toads (without dieing in the process), although they mainly eat yabbies, mussels and fish. 

They live in long complex burrow off the riverbank (much like a platypus) and are active day and night, although rarely seen. 

They are most easily differentiated from introduced rats by their black hairy tail with white tip, and size (longer and heavier than the Sewer rat, the next biggest rodent).",2021-04-14 09:50:09

Rakalis are key indicators of a healthy wetland system, and if they are struggling to find enough food in the form of invertebrates and fish, chances are that there has been a change in the water quality. Rakalis grow up to 60 cm long. Being the largest rat in Australia, they are useful to have around as they actually fight off introduced rats. You can tell them apart from introduced rats by their pale belly, mass of whiskers and the white tip on the end of their tail. 
Some Rakalis have developed the unusual ability of killing and eating the Cane Toads without being poisoned. Rakalis are either immune to Cane Toad poison, or they have figured out a way to avoid coming into contact with the poison glands.",2021-04-14 09:50:09

After considering the possible side effects, the national government of Fiji decided to release the toad in 1953, and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from Hawaii.Once the toads were established, a 1963 study concluded, as the toad's diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates, it was considered &quot;economically neutral&quot;. Today, the cane toad can be found on all major islands in Fiji, although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions

This beautiful creature is the world’s largest toad. Native to Central America and the northern range of South America, it is also an ancient species. This toad has taken countless millennia to slowly evolve an amazing lifestyle. It exudes poison from poison glands, its tadpoles are toxic when eaten, its poisonous skin is powerfully psychedelic and hallucinogenic, and it is a prolific reproducer. It was a delight to photograph this marvel of nature in its rightful place on the South American side of the Pacific Ocean. Because on the Australian side of the Pacific, the cane toad, Rhinella marinae, is a killing machine of disastrous proportions.

Only humanity could find a way to turn one of nature’s marvels into a pest. Hopefully humanity can also find a way to repair the damage it has caused, rightfully restoring the reputation of this beautiful toad.",2021-04-14 09:50:19

Description: A half a year ago on the way back from photographing a Marbled Frogmouth one night, I came across a frog just sitting on the track I was walking on. My torch was running out of batteries and I tried to snap a few photos of it before the torch went too dim. Later at home, while checking the photos, I had to face the fact that the photos where blurry. What I did manage was to find out what species of frog it was. From the markings and location, I narrowed it down to the Great Barred Frog.

I went back to the same location but this time with a fully charged and stronger torch. The first night I couldn’t find any amphibians as it hadn’t rained in a while. The next afternoon, the area I was in received some rain and that night I went out again. I went back to the same location as the night before. There it was, while on the track it was sitting up and resembled more a cane toad but coming closer it changed its position and flattened itself out and blended in with its surrounding. I found it again, the great barred frog.

Description:

The Great Barred Frog lives in moist forests and is usually found near permanent running water. It hides during the day, camouflaged beneath fallen leaves or burrowing into the loose soil. If threatened it can take long leaps into nearby water, where it then dives and hides among debris on the creek bed. (Source: Australian Museum)

Description: I know nothing about frogs and toads but this one was in a place called “Frogs Hollow” in a reserve in Brisbane’s northern suburbs. Never saw a green frog anywhere and from my rudimentary google search, the M shaped nose on this probably makes it a cane toad, and by the looks of it, one that is literally on its last legs. 

If any of my Flickr friends can confirm, I will update my description. I just doubt it was long for this world!

I might add, I am rather acquainted with Cane Toads. Brisbane Forest Park, as it was 15 years ago used to put on regular night toad catching events where we would don gloves and with torches go forth into the wild rainforest where we would not be game to tread in daylight (snakes and spiders) to catch toads in a massive hunt, attempting to win with the largest number or biggest toad for the night. We even got on the TV news. And we won both prizes. One night the catch by everyone for the evening was more than 800 toads, and we never made a ding in the population of these introduced and invasive species. But we did have fun.....but really, in the bush, in the dark, picking up toads in a frenzy of the hunt. What were we thinking?",2021-04-14 09:50:31

Description: Litoria caerulea, The Australian green tree frog, simply green tree frog in Australia, White's tree frog, or dumpy tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to Australia and New Guinea, with introduced populations in the United States and New Zealand, though the latter is believed to have died out. Wikipedia

The diet of the green tree frog consists mainly of insects such as moths, cockroaches, and locusts. They also eat spiders and can include smaller frogs and even small mammals (including bats) among their prey. Frog teeth are not suited to cutting up prey, so the food item must be small enough to fit inside its mouth.

I worry about our frogs because we also have, in large numbers, the introduced Cane Toad..they have the same diet as the tree frogs, so they are competitors. 

I've been worried about our frogs because of this but the weather conditions have been just right for the frogs. We have had thunderstorms and heavy rain several times lately, just the conditions the frogs love.",2021-04-14 09:50:38

Yellow-spotted Monitor (Varanus Panoptes)
The Yellow-spotted Monitor is a monitor lizard found in Arnhem Land, The Cape York Peninsula, western and southern inland Queensland and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. One of northern Australia's biggest predators, it prefers to live in tropical to semi-arid woodlands, particularly around floodplains or other permanent sources of water. It is a terrestrial lizard, meaning it spends most of its time on the ground.

Most Yellow-spotted Monitors are yellow with a background of brown or dark tan. They have a banded yellowish tail tip. Their size differs greatly depending on their sex: the female reaches an average total length of 90cm, while the male can be 120-140cm long.

The Yellow-spotted Monitor is an avid digger, and will either dig a burrow itself or take over an existing burrow, where they will spend most of their time, especially in the late dry season when little food is available. They forage on land, in water and in trees for their meals.

The prey of the Yellow-spotted Monitor consists of all kinds of foods, including fish, crabs, small birds, rodents, insects and even other smaller monitors that share its habitat, including the dwarf monitor and rock monitor. They also dig up and eat the eggs of turtles and crocodiles. The Yellow-spotted Monitor has an acute sense of smell and a forked tongue, and, like snakes, can often be spotted flicking their tongues in search of a meal.

One unique characteristic of the Yellow-spotted Monitor is the way it stands up on its hind legs when threatened or to get a better look at its environment, supporting itself with its tail. Despite their large size, these lizards are quite fast and will run to the nearest burrow or tree when chased.

It is believed that up to 90% of the Yellow-spotted Monitor population in the Top End has been decimated by the invasive Cane Toad (Rhinella marina), as biting a toad is enough to kill an adult. Breeding programs with captive lizards have been established to try to save this native lizard and return them to their native territory.

The female Yellow-spotted Monitor lays up to thirteen eggs in the wet season, which take more than seven months to hatch. In the past, the Yellow-spotted Monitor was one of the favorite foods of northern Australian Aboriginal tribes.

<b>Red-bellied Black Snake
Scientific Name: <i>Pseudechis porphyriacus</i></b>
Identification: A medium-sized snake, with a moderate to robust build and head barely distinct from the neck. Dorsal head and body colour is uniform black, except for the snout which is often pale brown. The lowest lateral scale rows and the outer edge of the ventral scales are bright crimson, fading to duller red, orange or pink in the middle of the belly. In the north of the range the ventral colour may be greyish-pink to white. The underside of the tail is black. Body scales are smooth and glossy. Eyes are medium size and shadowed by an obvious brow-ridge. The iris is very dark, and the pupil is round. Midbody scales in 17 rows, ventrals 170-215, anal scale divided, anterior subcaudals single, posterior divided (occasionally all single).  May be confused with the related Blue-bellied (or Spotted) Black Snake Pseudechis guttatus, Small-eyed Snake Cryptophis nigrescens, and Copperhead Austrelaps spp.
Size range: Average adult size 1.5 - 2m, with males growing slightly larger than females (among mature specimens in museum collections the range and mean for snout-vent length was 725-1440mm and 1059mm (males), and 734-1117mm and 939mm (females)). The largest specimen in an Australian museum collection was a male with a snout-vent length of 1440mm, however reliable sources have reported a maximum total length of about 2540mm (eight feet and four inches) for the species.
Distribution: Red-bellied Black Snakes occur disjunctly in northern and central eastern Queensland and then more continuously from southeastern Queensland through eastern New South Wales and Victoria. Another disjunct population occurs at the southern end of the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. The species does not occur on Kangaroo Island despite assertions to the contrary.
Habitat: This species is usually associated with moist habitat, primarily streams, swamps and lagoons (although they may also be found well away from such areas), within forests, woodlands and grasslands. They also inhabit disturbed areas and rural properties, and are often encountered around drainage canals and farm dams. The snakes shelter in thick grass clumps, logs, mammal burrows and dreys, and under large rocks. Individual snakes appear to maintain a number of preferred shelter sites within their home range.
Seasonality: During the spring breeding season males actively search for females and consequently spend more time in the open and travel further than females generally do (up to 1220m in a single day). As the breeding season winds down males reduce their activity and by summer there is no significant difference between males and females in the amount of time spent in the open, either basking or moving, and both sexes bask less and become less active than they were in spring.
Feeding and Diet: Red-bellied Black Snakes feed on a variety of vertebrates including fish, tadpoles, frogs, lizards, snakes (including its own species) and mammals. They search widely for prey on land and in water, and are known to climb to several metres. When hunting in water the snake may forage with only its head under or submerge itself fully. Prey captured under water may be taken to the surface or else swallowed while still submerged. Snakes have been observed deliberately stirring up underwater sediment as they hunt, presumably to flush out hidden prey. 
Other behaviours and adaptations: In the wild, active Red-bellied Black Snakes maintain a body temperature in the range 28 to 31º C during the day by shuttling between sunny and shady spots. The rate of heating in the morning is more rapid than the rate of cooling in the evening, an indication of their ability to control their temperature by behavioural (e.g. shuttling, body posture) and/or physiological means (e.g. by regulating blood flow to different parts of the body). RBBS are primarily diurnal however they can remain active well into the late evening if temperature permits. When fleeing a terrestrial predator, RBBS may enter water and stay submerged with just their head showing, or else dive under completely for as long as 23 minutes.
Life cycle: Courtship and mating among wild Red-bellied Black Snakes occurs primarily in spring (early October to November), although it may begin as early as late winter as suggested by the observation of blood residues around a female's cloaca in late August (mating can cause the female to bleed from her vent, presumably due to spines present on the male hemipenes). Males travel widely in search of receptive females and will engage in combat with any rival male that they encounter. Combat involves the two combatants spreading their necks and rearing up their forebodies, and hooking their necks around one another with a twisting motion that leads to the bodies becoming intertwined. After the initial engagement, they lie outstretched along the ground, but in some cases the forebodies remain raised. The object of the combat seems to be to push and hold the opponent down, and during the struggle the snakes may hiss and even bite each other (the biting is not serious as the snakes are largely immune to their species' venom). In the wild, the bouts may last from only a few minutes for up to half and hour, and in captivity, the same two snakes may engage in intermittent bouts over several days. During these bouts the snakes can become so pre-occupied that they are totally oblivious to their surroundings. Eventually a &quot;winner&quot; is determined and the snakes part ways, with the defeated male then leaving the area. When courting a female, the male will approach and begin to rub his chin around and over her body, and as he progresses he may twitch excitedly and even hiss and bite the female. If the female is curled and receptive she indicates her willingness to mate by stretching out and allowing the male to align with her. In the wild, females begin to develop yolking follicles in early spring and are gravid anytime between mid spring to late summer. Gravid females in some areas are known to gather in small groups (up to 6 individuals) towards the end of their pregnancies. These females bask together and will share the same night-time retreat. The reasons for these aggregations are unknown, although perhaps it allows for greater protection against predators. During late pregnancy females do not feed and stay close to their retreat. Four to five months after mating the female gives birth to between 5 and18 young that are born enclosed in a membranous sac. They emerge from the sac soon after birth (although they can remain inside for up to two days), and measure around 28cm in total length. Red-bellied Black Snakes are the only species in the genus Pseudechis that have live young (the other species all being egg-layers), and this ability gives them an advantage in cooler climates by allowing the female to have greater control over the temperatures at which her young develop. Red-bellied Black Snakes reach sexual maturity in 2-3 years, although there is a record of one male that was mature at only 19 months of age. During long periods of drought, reproduction may be limited or even cease altogether.
 Predators, Parasites and Diseases: The only recorded predators of adult RBBS, aside from humans, are feral cats, although presumably they would fall prey to other known ophidiophages, e.g. brown falcons and other raptors. Newborn and juvenile snakes face predation by smaller carnivorous birds, e.g. kookaburras, other snakes, frogs, and even invertebrates such as red-backed spiders. Red-bellied Black Snake are susceptible to the toxin of Cane Toads (Bufo marinus), and rapidly die from ingesting or even just mouthing them. Their decline in parts of Queensland and northern NSW is thought to be due to the presence of toads, although there are signs that their numbers are recovering in some areas. The species' known endoparasites include acanthocephalans, cestodes (tape worms), nematodes (round worms), pentastomids (tongue worms) and trematodes (flukes).

Description: Today I met my first cane toad. I say  'my' as he/she was sitting upon my lawn. Having moved home north from Sydney to Australia's sub-tropical zone in Queensland I was warned that this introduced pest would be one of the creatures that I'd have to deal &quot;hard&quot; with.

They were brought to the country from Hawaii as a hoped for solution to eat the grubs and beetles that infest sugar cane. At this the toads proved to be a dismal failure, but showed that they are masters of reproduction and now inhabit most of the northern areas of the continent. 

The problem with them is that they are highly toxic and not having any natural enemies, they poison any predatory animal that eats them, and this can be your pet dog or cat. So I've been instructed in the ways of 'dispatching' them. That being, take a long pair of barbecue tongs, pick up the toad, drop it into a bucket and spray with an antiseptic like 'Dettol'. This I'm told kills them instantly.

Description: 7 Days With Flickr
Sunday,fauna

The Freshwater Snake (also known as the Keelback) is olive brown with irregular dark cross-bands.  The body scales are strongly keeled, producing ridges that run along the snake’s body.  Flecks of pale skin can often be seen through the scales.  The belly is cream and usually flushed with a pink or orange tinge along the edges.  Dark bars can be seen between the sutures on the upper lip scales.  This species grows to 75 cm.  

Distribution:
Found in coastal areas of northern Australia from northern New South Wales to the Kimberley, Western Australia.

Habitat:
Lives in well watered situations along creeks and in swamps but also found in eucalypt forests, heaths, pastures, parks and suburban gardens. Habits:  This species is active both day and night.  It is usually found at ground level, but can climb well (a specimen was observed 5 m up a melaleuca tree in a swamp on Cape York Peninsula).

Danger:
A non-venomous, inoffensive species.

Food:
Feeds mainly on frogs, but fish, reptile eggs and mammals are also taken.  This species is one of the few Australian vertebrates to prey successfully on the introduced Cane Toad.  However, attempts by this snake to eat large toads sometimes have fatal consequences for the snake.

Breeding:
This species lays 5–12 eggs.  The hatchling snakes are around 15 cm from the tip of the snout to the base of the tail (snout-vent length).",2021-04-14 09:50:58
