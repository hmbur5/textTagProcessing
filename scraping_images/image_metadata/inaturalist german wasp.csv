Lignicolous on tairare (Beilschmiedia tarairi) branch lying in dense tairare / tawa (B. tawa) / kohekohe (Dysoxylum spectabile) forest (steep slope with understorey and ground cover virtually annihilated by cattle).

Fruiting bodies mostly past it (and I might add I was having the bejesus stung out of me by one *&^%$#@! German wasp (Vespula germanica) whilst taking these - so not the best images)...No wasp nest present - the little *&^%$#@ obviously didn't like me.

Fruiting bodies solitary, stalk 6-8 mm diameter, terete, fibrous, twisted, brownish with dark brown flakes (these peeling off in places); cap 25-30 mm diameter, variable ranging from circular to tabular to half circular, more or less flattened to concave or fluted (in all examples with prominent dark brown central depression), upper surface fawn coloured, mottled cinnamon brown, cap margins 'frilled' due to gills of underside forming an upturned rim; gills pale cream, interstices grey.

I am wondering if this posting is a munted / over mature state of http://naturewatch.org.nz/observations/2683634

https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/5658052/medium.jpg?1480597705,2016-12-01,,eddibisulli,"Vespula germanica (Fabricius, 1793) è una specie di imenottero Apocrita della famiglia delle Vespidae.

La Vespula germanica è originaria dell'Europa sebbene sia riuscita ormai ad acclimatarsi bene anche nel continente americano. È presente anche in Nuova Zelanda.

In primavera la regina svernante comincia a costruire un primo mucchietto di cellette; queste sono prodotte con schegge di legno secco o frammenti di cartone impastati con la saliva della vespa che vanno a formare una pasta modellabile. Il materiale appena modellato si indurisce e prende una consistenza cartacea. Le prime cellette sono coperte da un involucro delle dimensioni di una noce, sempre cartaceo ma questa volta impermeabile, che ripara il primo gruppo di celle nelle quali si sviluppano le prime operaie della nuova colonia. La regina, finché non nascono le operaie, si occuperà di ampliare il nido, difenderlo e ripararlo se rovinato, nonché di procurare il nutrimento per le larve: tutti compiti che spetteranno alle vespe operaie una volta nate; a quel punto alla regina non resterà che deporre le uova e assicurarsi che tutte le larve e le operaie siano esclusivamente sue figlie, uccidendo o cacciando eventuali intruse. Il nido quindi viene ampliato dalle operaie nascenti, aggiungendo sempre più strati attorno alla copertura iniziale che viene quindi demolita, per far aumentare il numero di cellette. Presto un solo piano di cellette non basta più e subito ne vengono costruiti altri paralleli al piano iniziale, collegati fra loro con appositi pilastri cartacei. In poco tempo il nido raggiunge le dimensioni di un panettone.

Mentre il nido aumenta di dimensione, la regina ha sempre più cellette a disposizione per deporre le uova; per tutta la durata dell'estate il nido continua ad ampliarsi e le operaie continuano ad aumentare di numero. Le ultime covate di operaie, essendo più nutrite, producono operaie grandi quanto regine e difficili nella distinzione da queste ultime. Una volta nate le ultime operaie è ormai autunno inoltrato e ci sono già migliaia di esemplari: allora la regina cessa provvisoriamente di deporre le uova per lasciare sufficiente spazio alla covata successiva. L'ultima covata, prima della morte della regina, genererà nuove regine ed esemplari maschi: è quasi inverno. Le operaie stanno ormai morendo e ne restano sempre meno dopo la morte della regina ormai troppo anziana. Le poche operaie rimaste si dedicano esclusivamente al nutrimento e alla difesa delle nuove femmine fertili e dei maschi per prepararli al volo nuziale che solitamente si svolge quando le temperature sono ormai basse. Le giovani regine ed i maschi, quindi, volano via dal nido di appartenenza e si disperdono assieme ad altri sessuati di altri nidi. Quando una femmina fertile incontra un maschio, non necessariamente proveniente da un diverso nido, ha luogo l'accoppiamento, dopo il quale il maschio muore e la femmina fecondata va a svernare nel legno marcio o sotto terra, in attesa della bella stagione per riavviare il ciclo vitale.",2021-04-05 15:39:34
