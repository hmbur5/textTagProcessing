Many of the houses and temples are finely sculptured. It lies in the heart of the Thar Desert (the Great Indian Desert) and has a population of about 78,000. It is the administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer District.

ORIGIN OF NAME
Jaisalmer is named after Maharawal Jaisal Singh, a Rajput king who founded the city in 1156 AD. &quot;Jaisalmer&quot; means &quot;the Hill Fort of Jaisal&quot;. Jaisalmer is sometimes called the &quot;Golden City of India&quot; because the yellow sand and the yellow sandstone used in every architecture of the city gives a yellowish-golden tinge to the city and its surrounding area.

The climate is dry. Throughout Jaisalmer only raincrops, such as bajra, jawar, motif, til, etc., are grown; spring crops of wheat, barley, etc., are very rare.

ECONOMY
Tourism is a major industry in Jaisalmer.

The Government of India initiated departmental exploration for oil in 1955–56 in the Jaisalmer area. Oil India Limited discovered natural gas in 1988 in the Jaisalmer basin.

Musicians and dancers are also a major cultural export from Jaisalmer to the rest of the world.

TOURISM
While Jaisalmer may always have been remote, it is filled with many artistic structures and monuments of local historical importance. Jaisalmer's medieval mud fortress and walled township make it a popular tourist destination. The surrounding desolate landscape evidences a stark, austere beauty. Camel safaris through the nearby desert dunes are popular with tourists; competition for business is fierce. Prices range wildly and one has to bargain for everything, hotel rates included. Jaisalmer is known for huge mark-ups which range between 400% to 500% depending on the product. So buying shawls, carpets, jewelry etc. can be a very time consuming and nerve rattling experience. A few quiet days spent wandering around the town and the surrounding desert can be a wonderful way of unwinding from the chaos of larger Indian cities.

Description: Osterhas

Untern Baum im grünen Gras
sitzt ein kleiner Osterhas`!
Putzt den Bart und spitzt das Ohr,
Macht ein Männchen, guckt hervor.
Springt dann fort mit einem Satz
Und ein kleiner frecher Spatz
Schaut jetzt nach, was denn dort sei.
Und was ist´s? Ein Osterei!

Once known as Jaisalmer state it is a World Heritage Site. The town stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone, crowned by a fort, which contains the palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples are finely sculptured. It lies in the heart of the Thar Desert (the Great Indian Desert) and has a population of about 78,000. It is the administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer District.

ORIGIN OF NAME
Jaisalmer is named after Maharawal Jaisal Singh, a Rajput king who founded the city in 1156 AD. &quot;Jaisalmer&quot; means &quot;the Hill Fort of Jaisal&quot;. Jaisalmer is sometimes called the &quot;Golden City of India&quot; because the yellow sand and the yellow sandstone used in every architecture of the city gives a yellowish-golden tinge to the city and its surrounding area.

The average rainfall is 209.5 millimetres. Highest ever recorded temperature was 48.0 °C; the lowest ever recorded temperature being −5.9 °C. Water is scarce, and generally brackish; the average depth of the wells is said to be about 76 m. There are no perennial streams, and only one small river, the Kakni, which, after flowing a distance of 48 kilometres, spreads over a large surface of flat ground, and forms Lake Orjhil (&quot;The Bhuj-Jhil&quot;). The climate is dry. Throughout Jaisalmer only raincrops, such as bajra, jawar, motif, til, etc., are grown; spring crops of wheat, barley, etc., are very rare.

ECONOMY
Tourism is a major industry in Jaisalmer.

The Government of India initiated departmental exploration for oil in 1955–56 in the Jaisalmer area. Oil India Limited discovered natural gas in 1988 in the Jaisalmer basin.

Musicians and dancers are also a major cultural export from Jaisalmer to the rest of the world. Merasi (formerly Manganiyar, a derogatory term meaning &quot;beggar&quot;) musicians have played the world over, and Queen Harish, the dancing desert drag queen, is touring the world and has featured in international movies.

TOURISM
While Jaisalmer may always have been remote, it is filled with many artistic structures and monuments of local historical importance. Jaisalmer's medieval mud fortress and walled township make it a popular tourist destination. The surrounding desolate landscape evidences a stark, austere beauty. Camel safaris through the nearby desert dunes are popular with tourists; competition for business is fierce. Prices range wildly and one has to bargain for everything, hotel rates included. Jaisalmer is known for huge mark-ups which range between 400% to 500% depending on the product. So buying shawls, carpets, jewelry etc. can be a very time consuming and nerve rattling experience. A few quiet days spent wandering around the town and the surrounding desert can be a wonderful way of unwinding from the chaos of larger Indian cities.

Description: Pushkar (Hindi: पुष्कर) is a town in the Ajmer district in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is situated 14 km  northwest of Ajmer at an average elevation of 510 m and is one of the five sacred dhams (pilgrimage site) for devout Hindus. According to Hindu theology, the pond at the Katas Raj temple Near Choa Saidan Shah in Chakwal District of Pakistan has a theological association with Shiva; it was formed by the tears of Lord Shiva which he is believed to have shed after the death of his wife, Sati. The story goes that when Sati died, Shiva cried so much and for so long, that his tears created two holy ponds – one at Pushkara in Ajmer in India and the other at Ketaksha, which literally means raining eyes, in Sanskrit. It is from this name that the word Katas is derived. It is often called &quot;Tirth Raj&quot; – the king of pilgrimage sites – and has in recent years become a popular destination for foreign tourists.

Pushkar is one of the oldest existing cities of India. It lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake. The date of its actual origin is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation.

Pushkar has many temples. Most of the temples are not very old because many temples were destroyed during Muslim conquests in the area. Subsequently, the destroyed temples were rebuilt. The most famous among all is the Brahma Temple built during the 14th century CE. Very few temples to Lord Brahma exist anywhere in the world. Other temples of Brahma include Bithoor in Uttar Pradesh, India; Khedbrahma in Gujarat, India; village Asotra near Balotra city of Barmer district in Rajasthan; Uttamar Kovil (one of the Divya Desams) near Srirangam, Tamil Nadu; Mother Temple of Besakih in Bali, Indonesia; and Prambanan in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The Pushkar lake has 52 ghats where pilgrims descend to the lake to bathe in the sacred waters.

Pushkar is also famous for its annual fair (Pushkar Camel Fair) held in November.

ETYMOLOGY
Pushkar in Sanskrit means blue lotus flower. Hindus believe that the gods released a swan with a lotus in its beak and let it fall on earth where Brahma would perform a grand yagna. The place where the lotus fell was called Pushkar. Pushkar word may be derived from word 'Pushkarni'means- lake. It may be derived from word Pushpa means flower and Kar means hand.

HISTORY
Pushkar is one of the oldest cities of India. The date of its actual founding is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation.

According to legend, Brahma was in search of a place for Mahayagna and he found this place suitable. After a long time, Brahma came to known that a demon, Vajranash, was killing people here so the Lord intoned a mantra on a lotus flower and killed the demon. During this process the parts of flower fell on three places which were later known as Jyaistha, Madhya and Kanistha Pushkar. After this Brahma performed a yagna to protect this place from demons. The consort of Brahma, Saraswati, were needed to offer Ahuti for the yagna but she was not there that time so Gayatri, a Gurjar girl, was married to brahma and performned yagna. This act made first wife of Brahma, Saraswati, angry and she cursed Brahma saying that he would be worshiped in Pushkar only.

The Mahabharata says that while laying down a programme for Maharaja Yudhishthara’s travel, “Maharaja after entering the Jungles of Sind and crossing the small rivers on the way should bathe in Pushkara&quot;. And, as per Vaman Purana, Prahlada on his pilgrimage to holy places visited Pushkarayana.

A Gurjara Pratihara ruler of Mandore, Nahadarava, restored this tirtha in the seventh century. He got the place cleared and the lake restored by making an embankment on the side of the river Luni. He rebuilt old palaces and built twelve dharmashalas (resting places) and ghats on three sides of the lake.

According to Rajputana Gazetteer Pushkar was held by Chechi Gurjars until about 700 years ago.Later Some shrines were occupied by Kanphati Jogis.

There are still priests from the Gurjar community in Pushkar temple, known as Bhopas.

The sage Parasara is said to have been born here. His descendants, called Parasara Brahamanas, are found in Pushkar and the surrounding area. The famous temple of Jeenmata has been cared for by Parasara Brahmans for the last 1,000 years.

It is also the venue of the annual Pushkar Camel Fair. In 1901, the town was part of the Rajputana Agency had a population of 3,831.

PUSHKAR FAIR
Pushkar fair continues for five days and these five days are a period of relaxation and merry-making for the villagers. This fair time is the most busy time for them, as this is one of the largest cattle fairs in the country. Animals, including over 50,000 camels, are brought from miles around to be traded and sold. Trading is brisk as several thousand heads of cattle exchange hands. All the camels are cleaned, washed, adorned, some are interestingly shorn to form patterns, and special stalls are set up selling finery and jewellery for the camels. Camels at the Pushkar fair are decorated with great care. They wear jewellery of silver and beads. There are silver bells and bangles around their ankles that jangle when they walk. An interesting ritual is the piercing of a camel's nose. It has more than 400 temples including the only one temple in India dedicated to the Hindu God Lord Brahma, the Creator of the Universe.

According to Indian mythology, after visiting all the Hindu pilgrim towns and temples (Four Dhams), if Pushkar is not visited for worship, then salvation is not achieved. According to the Hindu calendar Pushkar Fair commences in Nawami (ninth day of fortnightly phases of moon) and ends in Purnima (Full Moon) in the month of Kartika (October or November according to the lunar calendar). In Pushkar, one of the biggest Cattle Fair is also held for trading purposes and the best cattle in all categories are awarded. Countless people in their colourful attire gather to take a dip in the Holy Lake and pray to the deities. The whole town comes alive with vibrant folk music and dances, magic shows, horse and camel races and various other traditional entertainment competitions.Pushkar, with more than 12 local fairs and festivals of 10–15 days duration is a year round destination. It is a mellow town by the great lake of Pushkar amidst the perfume of jasmine and rose flowers. About 4,000 to 6,000 visitors from all over the world come to Pushkar everyday.

PUSHKAR LAKE
The prime attraction of Pushkar is the Pushkar Lake which is considered sacred like the Mansarovar Lake in Tibet. Pushkar has become a place of Hindu pilgrimage because of this holy lake. Legend has it that this lake was consecrated to Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe when a lotus dropped from his hand into the vale and a lake emerged in that place.

BRAHMA TEMPLE

Description: Dalhousie Crossing is like a daydream in the deep woods, the Nova Scotia Central Railway gone silent since 1982. Trains went north and south, and the Old Dalhousie Road went east and west across it. Now neither see any but off-road use. This road is a missing link of 7.7 kilometers, connecting a mostly straight line on a route that now needs a detour of twice that. Most of the land gets logged off and on, scattered cuts and back-and-forth brush from Highway 10 to Camel Hill Road. There's some kind of beauty about it, between the ugly wastes and crowded groves, below the bottom of Upper Thirty Lake and through to the LaHave River. There's a certain returning happening, of folks like me to the forest, stumbling through in search of what's hiding. It's history that means the most, covering ground that was named and once traveled as the only way through. Now you've got more options to get where you're going, so you're free to take the hard road again.

 i) What case did the young men bring to Hazrat Umar Farooq رضي الله عنهم?Answer:The young man brought a case to Hazrat Umar (R.A) by holding a strong and well-built countryman. He complained to Hazrat Umar (R.A) that the person had murdered his old father. They asked the Caliph to decide the case in favor of him and put forward a demand to punish the murderer for his crime with justice.ii) Why did the old man hurl a stone at the camel?Answer:When the villager reached the garden along with his camel. The camel ate a few hanging leaves from the branch of the tree. When the old man saw that, he hurled a stone with all his might at the camel and that severely hurt it on its head and the camel died.iii) Why did the villager ask Hazrat Umar Farooq رضي الله عنهم to delay the execution?Answer:The villager asked Hazrat Umar (R.A) to delay the execution because his father left some gold that he buried in the earth in the fields and no one knows the place. He had to give his younger brother his due share that’s why he wanted to go back and hand over that gold to a trustee so his brother would get his due share after his death otherwise if his brother did not get then he would get punishment on the Day of Judgment.iv)

Description: What Is Coronavirus? Human Covids (CoV) is a huge group of infections that can cause an assortment of sicknesses going from the regular cold to extreme illnesses like Middle East respiratory condition (MERS-CoV) and Severe intense respiratory disorder (SARS-CoV). The World Health Organization says the novel Covid (SARS-CoV-2) is another strain that had not been recently distinguished in people until late 2019.

Human Covid was first found in 1965 and represents numerous instances of the normal virus. The infection gets its name from its crown-like shape. Covids are zoonotic, which means they're sent among creatures and individuals. SARS-CoV was sent from civet felines to people and specialists speculate MERS-CoV is communicated from dromedary camels to people.
What Is Coronavirus?
Covids influence all age gatherings, and most are not hazardous. They frequently just motivation gentle indications like a stodgy nose, hack, and sore throat that can be treated with rest and over-the-counter meds. Most Covids spread like some other cold infections spread, including:

 - through the air by hacking and wheezing
 - close to home contact, for example, contacting or warmly greeting somebody who's wiped out
 - contacting an article with the infection on it, at that point contacting your mouth, nose, or eyes

L’artista, come per altri soggetti, affronta, più volte, nell’arco della sua lunga carriera, questo tema, per committenti diversi, ricercando, ogni volta, tagli e movimenti dissimili che, pur nel rispetto del testo biblico di riferimento, sembrano orientati a mettere al centro della scena il pozzo inserito in un contesto paesaggistico dilatato e rigoglioso, che permette un uso variato e gradevole della tavolozza e il trasferimento dal piano puramente religioso a quello profano della scena, in funzione anche decorativa.
Contenuta nelle dimensioni, l'opera presenta tutti i personaggi a mezzo busto, secondo un’inquadratura insolita per il tema, che si snoda in primissimo piano, accentuando il tono colloquiale dei protagonisti. Il tema (Genesi, 24) è assunto a simbolo della generosità e, spesso, quale prefigurazione dell’Annunciazione e ci presenta l’incontro fra Rebecca e un’altra giovane donna, che, giunte al pozzo, incontrano il vecchio servo di Abramo, Eliezer giunto in Caldea in cerca di una giovane sposa per Isacco in colei che avesse dato da bere a lui e ai suoi cammelli. “La fanciulla era molto bella di aspetto, vergine e non ancora conosciuta da alcun uomo” e poiché rispose generosamente Eliezer trasse fuori e offrì un pendente d’oro e due braccialetti per i suoi polsi, qui racchiusi in uno scrigno. Il tocco sapiente del pennello del Ricci s’infrange sulla tela in un gioco di chiaroscuri vigorosi e di tonalità decise, ancora intrisi di dolci cadenze di matrice correggesca, come nel bel viso di Rebecca.

The artist, as with other subjects, tackled this theme several times during his long career, for different clients, seeking, each time, different cuts and movements that, while respecting the biblical text of reference, seem to be oriented to put at the center of the scene the well placed in a landscape context dilated and lush, which allows a varied and pleasant use of the palette and the transfer from the purely religious to the profane of the scene, also in decorative function.
Limited in size, the work presents all the characters in half-length, according to an unusual framing for the theme, which unfolds in close-up, accentuating the colloquial tone of the protagonists. The theme (Genesis, 24) is taken as a symbol of generosity and, often, as a foreshadowing of the Annunciation and presents us with the meeting between Rebecca and another young woman who, having arrived at the well, meet Abraham's old servant, Eliezer, who had come to Chaldea in search of a young bride for Isaac in one who would give him and his camels a drink. &quot;The maiden was very beautiful in appearance, a virgin and not yet known to any man,&quot; and because she responded generously Eliezer drew out and offered a gold pendant and two bracelets for her wrists, here enclosed in a casket. The skilful touch of Ricci's brush breaks on the canvas in a game of vigorous chiaroscuro and strong tones, still imbued with sweet cadences of Correggio's matrix, as in the beautiful face of Rebecca.",2021-04-05 16:32:49

Description: Growing up in Nebraska, I couldn't imagine a place that I wanted to visit more or that seemed more impossibly far away than Egypt. I never had the chance to go until I was studying abroad in Spain in college. On a whim, I searched for plane tickets and found them, $200 round trip. Never mind the 14-hour layover; I knew that was my chance! After a subway trip, a shared taxi, a long walk completely lost and an hour-long camel ride, I arrived at the pyramids. I couldn’t believe my eyes. If asked to describe the Pyramids of Giza I would use terms like majestic or wondrous but even those don't adequately convey the grandeur of these structures. What struck me most that you cannot quite grasp from pictures is the size of the stones. Each stone near the base is as tall as me (5'1)! Also, the air was so dusty and smoggy while I was visiting that I couldn’t see the pyramids until I was almost at the base!

Cheaper cigarettes more terrible for you
Another investigation recommends that the accessibility of less expensive, off-brand cigarettes is related with an expansion in baby mortality. Specialists writing in JAMA Pediatrics considered the connection between cigarette costs and baby mortality in 23 European nations from 2004 through 2014. 

You vape without utilizing nicotine
By and large, vaping without nicotine seems, by all accounts, to be more secure than vaping with nicotine. Be that as it may, the in general long haul wellbeing of vaping, paying little mind to nicotine presence, requires more examination. In spite of the fact that examination is restricted, a few investigations have analyzed the impacts of without nicotine e-cigarettes and those that contain nicotine. 

It OK to smoke once per month

Long does smoke stay on your breath
Smoke can wait noticeable all around for 2 to 3 hours after you've completed a cigarette, even with a window open. Additionally, regardless of whether you limit smoking to one room, the smoke will spread to the remainder of the house where individuals will breathe in it. 

Smoked fish terrible for you
So the writing is on the wall: smoked fish can be a nice wellspring of omega-3 fats (as long as the crude fish was wealthy in them). In any case, it is an outrageously pungent approach to get omega-3s. A 3-ounce serving of new, prepared salmon has 51 milligrams (mg) of sodium.

Hot smoked fish, like trout and mackerel, are scrumptious chipped into plates of mixed greens or threw with warm pasta, particularly with a cream sauce. Here are some different thoughts: Add chipped smoked trout to potato serving of mixed greens. Or then again serve it separated overcooked beets threw with lemon juice and new dill. 

Age do hefty smokers kick the bucket
The investigation shows that smokers bite the dust generally youthful. An expected 23 percent of reliable substantial smokers never arrive at the age of 65. This is 11% among light smokers and 7 percent among non-smokers. Future abatements by 13 years on normal for weighty smokers contrasted with individuals who have never smoked.

Light smoking is characterized as smoking five or less cigarettes each day. It can likewise mean skipping cigarettes a few days and getting one every so often. &quot;Light smokers may not think about their periodic propensity as unsafe. They may not see themselves as smokers.

(525th Fighter Transport Squadron)

70th Anniversary Edition (2018)

The Douglas DC-3 (DC – Douglas Commercial) is considered by many as the aircraft that revolutionized commercial air travel in the 20th Century. The maiden flight of the DC-3 took place on December 17, 1935, the 32nd anniversary of the Wright Brother’s historic flight at Kitty Hawk. Now airlines were able to be profitable without depending on U.S. Mail subsidies and passengers could now fly transcontinental with just one re-fueling stop. There are many DC-3s still flying 75 years after their maiden flights.

During the Berlin Airlift that lasted from June 24, 1948 until May 12, 1949 the 86th Fighter Group had chosen a camel as its mascot and flew one in from Libya that they named Clarence. In October 1948 a C-47A with Clarence aboard and designated “Camel Caravan To Berlin” left Neubiberg AB laden with thousands of pounds of candy, games and toys as a good will gesture for the children of Berlin that were caught in the Soviet imposed blockade of the city.

Picture Camel:
Wiesbaden, Germany, October 21, 1948: Clarence the Camel stands in a C-47 aircraft amid some 5,000 pounds of food, candy, books, games and toys on the way to Berlin for distribution to children of the blockaded city during the Berlin Airlift. Clarence — mascot of the pilots of the 86th Fighter Group at Neubiberg Air Force Base — was flown in from Tripoli, Libya, for a tour of the U.S. zone of Germany after the &quot;&quot;camel caravan&quot;&quot; stop in Berlin.

During the Berlin Airlift, the United States Air Force 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Neubiberg air base in West Germany operated a C- 47 Skytrain support aircraft. On 22nd October 1948, as a gift for the children of Berlin, the C-47 was used to fly 7,000lb (3175kg) of Candy, along with a baby Camel called 'Clarence' into Tempelhof airport in the US sector of Berlin. The camel was the mascot of the 525th Fighter Squadron based at Neubiberg and had been bought by a member of the squadron in Tripoli for $50 and shipped to Germany in the bomb bay of a B-26 Invader bomber. When Berlin was besieged the base personnel decided to present both it and the candy to the children as a gesture of goodwill for Christmas.

Douglas C-47 Skytrain:
Designed to meet an American Airlines requirement for an enlarged version of the DC-2, the DC-3 was first flown on December 17th, 1935. Capable of carrying 24 passengers at a cruising speed of 180 mph, the DC-3's speed and long range revolutionized commercial air travel in the 1930s and 40s, when it carried 90 percent of the world's air travelers. Early DC-3s used Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines, but Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp Radials were fitted to later versions; these engines had better single engine performance and allowed the DC-3 to fly at higher altitudes.

Description: The Red Rock Ranch in the Beach Mountains, two miles north of Van Horn, is one of the only public tours offered on private land in West Texas.    Some of the rocks on the ranch are more than a billion years old, among the oldest in Texas.

The Pre-Cambrian sandstone outcropping found at Red Rock is one of only four natural Precambrian sandstone exposures in the Western Hemisphere.  Who knew something like this existed in West Texas let alone Van Horn.  And with that, you might even be asking yourself where in the world is Van Horn?   The easy answer is Van Horn is right near Sierra Blanca, which you will not know either.  If you travel Interstate 10, however, you would have no choice except to pass through Van Horn either on your way to or from El Paso.

Back to the fascinating Red Rock Ranch, which is home to Darice McVay.   If we are to believe her, a host of imaginary friends dot the wide expanse landscape.  “Imagination can be as creative as one wishes,” according to ranch owner Darice McVay. “E. T. under a camel’s chin, Donald Duck or Puff the Magic Dragon, an Indian satellite dish and Red Rock Ranch’s very own Easter Island rock” are all rock formations created by wind erosion over millions of years.  If you dive into the stories with Darice, you'll not only chuckle but also be mesmerized by the natural beauty that will surround you.

Many of these formations are naturally balanced, as if a sculptor has worked magic.

22 images displayed.
Each image can be viewed from the perspective of a story about humans and our struggle to be..Clearly this is what the work is about…..But these particular works show the part that is beauty or so it seems at first….Much of glenn’S work probes and exposes the other aspects of life..The lost the forgotten the neglected …Those who have so little……He sees both components and has dedicated his work to this portrayal….It  is as if he is saying to us….”What gives….How can you neglect your brothers?”

These images have perfect composition….The structres seem to fit to produce a glorious whole… A complete paradigm of us….The colors enhance the expressions reveal…..
Glenn is present but not disruptive…For this is no fashion shoot….This is about the vicissitudes of life and  the eternal struggle to master and survive…..Yet the composition can stand as abstract forms very muchlike suprematism of the 20’S….

The rising sun reveals camels in diverse poses about to commence a days travail…It hints at the arduous life these people have for themselves….How much they must do to end up with so little…He is really saying what is our responsibility in this matter…Do we have one?  Juxtapose this image with boats at rest in cassis,,,boats of those who have…….Again the question emerges of social responsibility……
So imbedded in the beauty is the pain of being and struggling…Conveyed by a true master….

Two Class 151 DMUs were produced in 1985, as Metro-Cammell's alternative prototype Sprinter (to the BREL Class 150s that had appeared the previous year).  However, BR adopted the Class 150 as standard.  Problems with their transmission plus their by now non-standard nature led to the Class 151s being withdrawn in 1989.  They were eventually scrapped in 2004.

Description:   Another surprise on our adventure last Sunday.   We were on a road we had traveled many times in the past but these guys really caught our eyes and were not there the last time we passed through this area.   Happily for us the owner and a neighbor were hanging out just at the gate and we got to talk with them.    Seems the farmer liked Zebras and had an opportunity to acquire a few so went for it.  Notice the stripe pattern on the butt of the one in the background compared to the one in the foreground.  They are actually two different breeds of Zebras!  He also had a Camel and some cool spotted donkeys along with various sizes and colors of goats.   Seriously ...  we never know what to expect and zebras in the middle of farm land is, well pretty awesome actually!  :) ",2021-04-05 16:33:34

Tips
Although patients come with isolated injuries, we always have to make sure that they do not have other injury findings. Therefore, approaching systematically to the patient is important. At this moment, please remember primary and secondary surveys of multiple trauma. The animal attacks may create multiple injuries on patients, and they should be evaluated as multiply injured patients. After you ruled our multiple or life, organ, extremity threatening injury, you can deep dive into isolated injuries. In this case, knee injury after a direct hit.

Of course, inspection and palpation are essential in every extremity injury. Evaluating the patient for neurovascular problems and range of motions are applied in almost every extremity trauma. But sometimes, clinical presentations or findings can be subtle and you may need a better tool. In these case, we recommend using Ottawa Knee Rules.

Description: 
It was in September last year in my hometown, Xi'an, a city in central north China. It is a dry and sunny place. 
A man was wearing a mask of monkey 🐒 and a face mask. I saw him on that sunny day. I found it funny and interesting. I think it was a joke on the situation we are going through. I wanted to record this funny man. But I didn't have a camera 📷.
I saw picture of a camel 🐪 walking towards the symbol of the city Bell Tower or the Big Goose Pagoda on local buses. I found it a right picture of the city's location. We are on the edge of dessert. 
I searched online pictures of man with masks of animals and camels, combined them into a drawing. 
For me, it is recording our time. It also has a strong character of my hometown city.
